The reason I ask is because it seems to me that the believers must expect the price to rise substantially over the coming years, so wouldn't it be wiser to hang on to every single bitcoin they have? For example, if I owned some shares and was expecting them to rise in price, I likely wouldn't sell them right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, when a person decides to get bitcoin for the first time they usually would need to buy it with fiat currency. But that means that a current holder has to sell to them. If supply and demand balances out, doesn't that mean that there are lots of sellers that aren't expecting the price to rise much in the near future. I realize that people will also be selling for other reasons, but there must be some that prefer fiat currency, else they wouldn't sell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, if all goes well with bitcoin and the price continues to rise steadily, that's causing deflation. So won't that mean people holding off on making large purchases because they know they can get the same product for less next year. e.g. if you want t buy something that costs 2 BTC now, and you expect BTC to double in value against USD, then you are better waiting until that happens and buy for 1 BTC.  \n",

      "We hear the trope \"LN transactions are Bitcoin transactions\" all the time.\n",
      "Let's examine that.\n",
      "I think most of us would say that if Alice and Bob each have an account on Coinbase worth 1 btc then we might say that both Alice and Bob own Bitcoins. After all they each can check their Coinbase balance and it says 1 btc.\n",
      "But Alice and Bob are choosing to leave their Bitcoin on an exchange. What we know after MtGox is that COINBASE owns the 2 Bitcoins associated with Alice and Bob's accounts. Alice and Bob each own an IOU for one Bitcoin payable on demand by Coinbase. If Coinbase blows up tomorrow there is nothing on the blockchain that proves that Alice or Bob owned any Bitcoin at all. In fact if Coinbase blows up, Coinbase still controls the 2 Bitcoins belonging to Alice and Bob.\n",
      "And if Alice sends her Bitcoin to Bob on Coinbase? Coinbase generates a ledger entry for this transaction but it is Coinbase, not Bob, who controls the Bitcoin.\n",
      "So we say that \"Bitcoin that are not in a wallet whose keys you control, are not your Bitcoin.\" What we will see is that when one uses Lightning, the Bitcoin associated with that transaction are \"not in a wallet with keys you control\" and therefore \"not your Bitcoin\" - in fact they aren't Bitcoin at all, but IOUs of other Bitcoin just like the Coinbase transaction.\n",
      "A transaction that happens like the one on Coinbase is called an off-chain transaction. The key thing to note is that off-chain transactions do not reassign Bitcoins to a new owner. They are simply IOUs that indicate that this transfer needs to happen sometime in the future. That's why off chain transactions are best thought of as IOUs or promissory notes.\n",
      "So along comes Lightning. Lightning promises, using some interesting cryptography, to offer instant p2p transactions. That part is great. But are these Bitcoin transactions?\n",
      "Well they're clearly denominated in Bitcoin. But so were Alice and Bob's Coinbase accounts. We have to find out at what point a Lightning transaction produces a true \"Bitcoin transaction\" - assigning coins to a unique Bitcoin wallet that the recipient controls.\n",
      "Turns out that Lightning transactions are IOUs just like Coinbase transactions. So while a Lightning transaction appears to instantly transfer Bitcoins, in reality it instantly signs an IOU. The Bitcoin are not transferred until some other time in the future (this is the step called \"settlement\").\n",
      "So where are the actual Bitcoins while all these Bitcoin-IOU transactions are going on? They are held in a Lightning hub.\n",
      "Now \"Hub\" is a word the Lightning devs don't use anymore - they will tell you that Lightning is not \"hub and spoke\", \"but peer to peer.\" \"Hub\" fell out of use with good reasons - hubs are bad. Remember Bitcoin is censorship resistant: any given miner might choose to reject your transaction, but any other miner is free to include it. But if Lightning transactions go through hubs, then any hub might be able to censor transactions between its \"spokes.\" So devs stress that Lightning is really peer-to-peer.\n",
      "It turns out that just because a technology allows peer to peer connections doesn't mean it will form into a peer to peer network topology.\n",
      "We can see that tcpip is inherently peer to peer but produces a strong set of hubs and spokes (do you run your own Web or mail servers?)\n",
      "Lightning works the same way. While the technology allows any user to create a \"channel\" with any other user (making it inherently peer to peer) in practice nobody can leave channels open to everyone they pay. Since opening and closing channels each requires a Bitcoin transaction, it is inefficient to even open a channel unless one will frequently transact over that channel. Since each channel ties up Bitcoins that cannot be spent elsewhere until the channel is closed, then each channel represents a unique cost to hold open.\n",
      "So you can't use Lightning to pay for coffee peer to peer. It would take a confirmed on chain transaction to establish a channel between you and the coffee shop, then a Lightning transaction to pay for the coffee, then another Bitcoin transaction to close the channel. That's three transactions to replace one regular Bitcoin transaction.\n",
      "You could create a channel and fund it with enough Bitcoin to pay for all possible coffees. That would let you pay via Lightning peer to peer with the coffee shop. But it would also require you to essentially prepay all your future coffees up front.\n",
      "Of course this is not how Lightning advocates expect you to use their payment network. You are expected to place your funds in a hub server. That server will maintain open channels with other hubs. So when you want to pay for coffee, the hub server where you store your funds signs an IOU with the hub server where the coffee shop stores its funds and sends it over to that hub. The \"peers\" never actually transact.\n",
      "So where are the Bitcoin? On the hubs. Not in your control.\n",
      "When the coffee shop owner receives the Lightning transaction, she received an IOU for Bitcoins from the purchaser. The Bitcoins stayed on the hub.\n",
      "So hubs are like banks and Lightning is like SWIFT: you keep you Bitcoin on a hub, and the hub \"empowers\" your Bitcoin to be instantly transactable over Lightning with other hubs, at the expense of having to trust a third party with your Bitcoins.\n",
      "Now it's true that I am comparing Lightning to other off chain transactions like Coinbase and that there are differences.\n",
      "In software we have this concept called \"leaky abstractions.\" What this means is that when we try to hide something messy with a simplifying abstraction, something invariably gets lost. A transaction on Coinbase is an example. If Alice sends Bob some Bitcoin, actually performing the transaction is hard: it takes time and costs money to move Bitcoin on the blockchain. But if I create an abstraction of the Bitcoin that Alice wants to send Bob, I can transfer the abstraction immediately and for free, and handle the underlying details later. Bob and Alice can be unaware that the Bitcoin they thought they exchanged were really only symbols in a database - at least until Coinbase blows up. Then it becomes painfully aware that the \"symbol is not the thing.\"\n",
      "A Coinbase transaction is an example of a kind of leaky abstraction. As long as everything works, the \"abstract\" transaction on Coinbase is \"pretty much as good as\" a real transaction on the blockchain. But if something goes wrong, only the real transaction counts.\n",
      "Gold and fiat money are another example. A paper certificate for one ounce of gold really is almost as good as one ounce of gold (better, in some ways). But the symbol is not the thing: people can sell all the real gold making the paper worthless.\n",
      "All of this speaks to the fact that a Lightning transaction - which exchanges IOUs for future Bitcoins that users do not hold in wallets they themselves control - is not a Bitcoin transaction, but a transaction of IOUs. It is an abstraction.\n",
      "Now Lightning isn't a fallible human system like paper fiat. Lightning relies on computer science to theoretically make it impossible to steal Bitcoin or inflate the money supply.\n",
      "Lightning may work perfectly - but it's still just IOUs, not actual Bitcoin in my wallet that I control, verifiable by every full node on the network. Any imperfections in Lightning contribute to the \"leakiness\" of its ability to abstract a Bitcoin transaction.\n",
      "In the end, all software engineers will tell you that \"all non trivial abstractions are leaky.\" The less trivial, the more leaky. And the more leaky the abstraction, the less the abstraction is worth relative to a real transaction. A Lightning transaction is clearly worth less than the equivalent on chain transaction.\n",
      "So Lightning isn't Bitcoin any more than paper gold is real gold, and therefore should be considered an alternative money (altcoin) based on Bitcoin IOUs.\n",
      "When normal people use bitcoin why are they going to stick to all the ideological concepts of bitcoin instead of changing the protocol? \n",
      "\n",
      "Most people are okay with things like inflation and regulations and reversible transactions and non austrian and non libertarian money. \n",

Since I have not met this vision of god referred to, one life form unified, I would not know if I should trust or not or what interaction I may be interested in.

      "Bitcoin at its heart is one simple thing: a computer network. UTXOs are not coins, they are notes in a bunch of nodes on a network. They are not in the physical sense ownable, they are controllable, as in the private keys that allow you to transfer control are what allows you to do that. The private key is what you own. You do not own the bitcoins(notes in the ledger), you own the private key controlling them, and the private key is not equivalent to those entries in the ledger. Without the NETWORK, those keys are completely useless. \n",

If someone tries to rip you off you can instantly settle the current balance in channel on the main chain, because what LN transacts with is pre-signed bitcoin transactions.\n",

Say what you want about fee markets, about other opinions you have on how to scale, but this is factual.

When I bought my first bitcoins weeks ago I immediately transferred them on bitcoin-core. In my eager ignorance I was unaware that it implied to set up the whole 50Go blockchains. Thing is : I have a fairly low bandwidth and a not powerful laptop, so the client instillation kept crashing on and on, leaving my coins in the un-synchronized limbo of the software. For some obscure reasons I was also unable to plug my wallet into blockchain.info, whether I copy-paste the wallet in the importation window or dump and import the private key directly (please don't ask for more details I am literally a bitcoins noob). So here I was, feeling stupid, with a unusable wallet allegedly containing 0.4 BTC.\n",
      "After wandering around trying to sort this out, I eventually reached out to www.walletrecoveryservices.com, and Dave helped me out in a very friendly fashion. Because of New Year Eve it took him some days to process the service and because of that he even offered me to not charge me the 20% fee. \n",

      "A core value that has a lot to do with how bitcoin works and why it works is related to the idea of decentralization.  We all know this but sometimes we forget.  Decentralization cannot be limited only to the bitcoin client.  If we had developers that all worked at some central authority this would be just as much of a threat as if a few miners managed to control all the hashing power.  There is no reason multiple companies and a diversity of developers cannot maintain multiple or many bitcoin clients.  In this manner it will be impossible for one group to control bitcoin in a negative way.  All changes would really require a true consensus of the community.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The current situation with Core is really quite the opposite.  We have a few coders funded mostly by one big company.  It is at the very least arguable that this company has interests that could be different than that of the proper functioning of the network.  Even if it did not it still poses an unnecessary risk of centralization.  Isn't it interesting how Core coders talk about decentralization, but in fact they are really very very guilty of violating this most sacred of principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "A bit on soft forks: they are passive aggressive, and lack true consensus.  Nearly anything can be done with these and later eventually people will be forced to upgrade.  Hard forks are not the boogeyman they are made out to be (by Core) they are the way the network gains consensus.  Even if there were multiple implementations 80% hard forks could be agreed upon in advance.  This means there would be no fork until 2 weeks after the consensus was reached.   \n",

What I'm wondering is if bitcoin could be used as a form of \"energy storage\" to give balance to the grid when renewable energy production spikes. I live in Ontario, Canada, and [we often produce too much electricity and end up paying to dump excess electricity]( What would prevent a grid operator from setting up a bitcoin mining operation that generates revenue when too much electricity is being produced? I know that there is a significant cost in keeping miners up to date, but if the cost of the electricity is $0, would it not be profitable?

The broken uncollapsable comment chains start at Luke-Jr's post, and he's also made the following posts uncollapsable too (the ones directly after Luke-Jr's) to make the thread even more difficult to process, and to give attention to these threads that he deems are supportive of his cause.

      "* To make it extremely difficult to digest information below these long comment chains, because you can't collapse them you have to scroll and scroll to see the comments below them.

      "**TL;DR:** Theymos and his mods have been using every trick in the book to manipulate peoples perceptions in /r/Bitcoin. He went to the lengths of creating his own custom CSS bug to disable comment collapsing on comments that are in support of him, and to make threads difficult to digest by moving massive comment chains to the top of the thread and then making them uncollapsable so that people have to scroll for 3 years to read the comments underneath them.\n",

      "1. Fees will increment up as needed to replace any losses in the block reward. IE if a miners collected a $100 a day $75 block reward and $25 in fees, and the block reward falls to $50, the miners collectively are going to increase fees to receive the difference maintain the same revenue, the reality is its blended in that Bitcoin price will appreciate but the knock effect is the same.   The market will pay it because the overall cost of security is what matters, not what you pay per transaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Bitcoin appreciation will raise the fiat value of fees. This feeds into point 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Fees are based on KB anyways and have no relation to fiat value transferred. This feeds into points 1 and 2.  As bitcoin appreciates small fiat value transfers may be consumed by the fees alone. \n",

      "In the short-term fees cannot rise in any meaningful way because there just isn't enough demand, and fees are so low anyways. Additionally the Segwit implementation is going to constrain any fee increases, along with other improvements. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also wallets are going to get smarter about fee calculation; if you look through the data it looks like people overpay fees in many instances simply because fees are so low to begin with it really makes no difference if you spend 3 cents or 6 cents or even 15 cents. If you want your transaction confirmed on the next block.\n",
      "\n",

Because the start of the chain will be lost it can be confirmed by storing a hash transaction in the chain each year that is the hash of all transactions the year previous.

I guess this means fewer parties have the capital to start a profitable mining operation?  and I guess that means fewer parties are in control of the changes that are made to the software?  So what are the hardware limitations for mining?  Why can't you do it on a personal computer, not for profit, but to claim your vote as a bitcoin user?  Isn't there some way to allow for smaller nodes or something that can reject or verify transactions but don't have to run the full software or something?

      "I am sending you this message because the crypto community is too heavily censored, please read carefully.\n",
      "The original of idea bitcoin is to create a decentralized money system that prevents censorship and being shutdown. Proof of work seemed like a good way to achieve that. The real power in the bitcoin world is helt by the miners, as long as the mining process is properly decentralized bitcoin will be decentralized. But real world competition caused many cracks to appear in this model, the first flaws that appeared were pooled mining (centralizing power with mining operators), then came ASICs (Centralizing power with mining operators with good industry connections), then came cheap electricity + latency issues (Centralizing power with mining pools with access to cheap electicity and low latency to others big mining pools). These pressures has essentially caused mining to be centalized mainly in China because there they have cheap electricity, good industry for creating ASICs and low latency to other chinese mining pools (and high latency to the rest of the world).\n",
      "One important thing to keep in mind is that bitcoin itself can evade capital controls and move seamlessly accross borders. But mining equipment cannot. It would be easy to confiscate all mining equipment in the country and use it to destroy bitcoin.\n",
      "So what is the solution to this problem? Proof of stake is the solution because it removed the physical element and allows network voting power to move seamlessly accross borders too. Traditional Proof of Stake contains some flaws like the Nothing at Stake problem. But the new algorithm designed for proof of stake in Ethereum solved all these issues.\n",
      "The bitcoin developer community has proven that it is unable to make even small changed to the consesus algorithm. So completely switching to a different model is never going to happen.\n",
      "If you are willing to open your mind and learn about how Ethereum will beat bitcoin by being far superior to bitcoin watch the videos of Devcon1\n",
      "Bitcoin is doomed and Ethereum will replace it.\n",
      "Obviously most people involved in Ethereum are aware of this. But for most other people it is not so obvious. But it is hard to convince the masses because they are not reading enough information about Ethereum, either because of censorship in subs or because of denial.\n",
      "Therefore I think it is the mission of each of us to get the word out. Only by saying it often and giving clear examples we can teach the masses what we already know. Try to reach at least on uninformed person every day. (If you lack ideas, just post the link to this post in different reddit subs with target audience).\n",
      "First of all it is important to remind people that Bitcoin was also once small, and that people also did not believe in Bitcoin because they couldn't imagine what benefit it would give over conventional payment systems. That perception changed dramatically for bitcoin and the same will happen to Ethereum. It is important to emphasise this because people often use the psychological principle of Social Proof to make decisions in unknown situations, this is currently working against Ethereum, the underlying reasoning is, \"If Ethereum is so great why is it so cheap?\", \"If Ethereum is so great why is everyone talking about Bitcoin?\", \"If Ethereum is so great, why are the smart people X, Y and Z not invested in it?\".\n",
      "Second of all it is important to emphasise that not only is Ethereum a crypto that offers a whole new concept of the decentralized web, it is also better than Bitcoin at being a currency for payments. This is easy to show by explaining a real world scenario. Imagine the perfect crypto currency, obviously it should be possible to re-implement the most convenient payment systems used today using that crypto currency, and doing so in a decentralized way, with no added fees or middle man. It should be able to behave very much like cash in being able to spend it quick and easy. The most similar electronic product that offers this is the anonymous tap to pay, prepaid payment card. It is easy, it is anonymous, it wont be hacked like phones, it has the ability to limit exposure to compromise by having limited balance that automatically recharged and the end of the day. Implementing this in Bitcoin would not be possible because the small chip in the card is not connected to the internet, and sharing your private key is a security hazard. But what if your wallet/contract could use asymmetric encryption to accept a different secret payment key on every payment. This way it is possible to implement the payment with a touch to pay card in a secure way. In Ethereum it is also possible to program a contract to recharge a wallet at the end of every day for added security, It is also possible to automatically exchange Ethereum for a token that is backed by a stable currency for those merchants that are worried about exchange fluctuations.\n",
      "Third of all it is important to note that Bitcoin is never going to be implementing these changes. Look how hard it is for them to implement a blocksize increase. Changing the scripting language to Turing complete would be a far more controversial change. One that the miners will probably never agree to this. And also keep in mind that quick payments need either zero-confirmation transactions or fast blocktime.\n",
      "So if Ethereum has the potential to implement the most convenient payment system imaginable but Bitcoin cannot then one can only conclude that Ethereum will win in the long run. Bitcoin will die like Myspace, and Ethereum will become the golden standard.\n",

A lot of deserved praise has been given to Hearn throughout the years, but at this point he has proven beyond all doubt that his true motivation was wealth and fame. Mike Hearn is a narcissisist who only cares about himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Let's just review the most important and relevant facts:*\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Mike Hearn has been in disagreement with the development of Bitcoin for quite some time. Some of his concerns have been legit, while others have been fear mongering. He created XT in response where he had dictator power and then whined about people not kneeling before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. When Mike diagnosed Bitcoin with terminal cancer Bitcoin was actually doing good, really good. The Bitcoin price was hovering around ~450. It was seeing more venture capital, more activity and more press than ever. Are there looming concerns in the future? Yes. Are there tons of people working on solutions? Yes. Was, or more importantly is Bitcoin terminally ill? No. \n",

      "3. This announcement was co-orchestrated with his employer to further their cause. Him and his new employers all got to exit while Bitcoin was doing great. In essence he jumped ship while it was sailing beautifully and then decided to do his best to sink it after reaching safety. Disturbing behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The dishonest and amoral aspect here is the fact that Mike Hearn decided to sacrifice the community whom has built him his fortune. He did not create Bitcoin and the code was open source, his own contributions did not make him rich, rather the believers in Bitcoin made him rich. Code is worth nothing without adoption. He was willing to throw us all under the bus, after pocketing his profit, only to pursue further riches in the banking sector. It's clear that Mike Hearn was never an idealist, he was a disillusioned Google employee who saw an opportunity to 'be someone' in Bitcoin, and when he was no longer influential he wanted it to burn.\n",

Shortly after this about face it is [revealed]( that Cryptsy was running a fractional reserve.

      "\n",
      "This was written in 1993, a full 15 years before Bitcoin was conceived. So why did it take so long? Because there were other electronic money systems that were attempted and failed. In order to understand Bitcoin, I believe it's important to understand the context of these past failures.\n",

      "In the 6 page paper, he laid out an electronic cash system which provided the “inability of third parties to determine the payee, time, or amount of payments made by an individual.” In order to accomplish this, he came up with a beautiful system called a “blind signature.” It was secure, but it had a big non-cryptographic fatal flaw: It required a trusted third party (bank) in order to function. The third party could refuse to make or take payments and do all sorts of other nastiness. That didn't matter to Chaum because his company would be the bank, and he would not violate those ideals. Using these concepts he founded a company called DigiCash (here is the post-mortem):\n",

      "Not to be deterred by prior failure another digital currency company was started around 1998: [E-gold]( This was met with significantly more success in adoption. My theory is that E-Gold succeeded where DigiCash failed because E-gold provided a tangible good (gold) as a backing. It’s hard for a consumer to accept *data as money* if they have little knowledge of what the past and current money systems are based on. Ultimately, E-gold met a different failure mode: the State (see wiki article for details). I strongly believe that had DigiCash survived to E-gold’s level of adoption, it would have either been co-opted or obliterated by this mechanism as well.\n",

      "There are a number of other examples of failures which have occurred in “E-Cash” world: Beenz, Liberty Reserve, PayPal, etc.  There’s a whole other story about PayPal, but for brevity we’ll just say it “co-opted” rather than “obliterated.” These numerous failures were a bit of an ideological crisis for the Cypherpunks. Many were (and many still are) of the opinion that a viable e-cash could not be created without ending in two failure modes: Co-opted (and thus neutered) by existing government/corporate power structures or destroyed because it threatened the aforementioned structures. This is something that’s played out in the physical world as well (see Liberty Dollar).\n",

There were engineered answers to the problem, but none were thought to be resilient enough to withstand an open network with dishonest (and even irrationally evil) participants. Most knew that centralized solutions would fail because they had already been tried (even when created by their own). There were a few solutions that were close to solving the problem but missed the mark (RPOW), were never implemented (bit-gold and b-money), or weren’t intended to be a general solution (hashcash). \n",

      "\n",
      "> For transferable proof of work tokens to have value, they must have monetary value.  To have monetary value, they must be transferred within a very large network - for example a file trading network akin to bittorrent.\n",
      "\n",
      "> To detect and reject a double spending event in a timely manner, one must have **most past transactions of the coins in the transaction, which,   naively implemented, requires each peer to have most past transactions, or most past transactions that occurred recently. If hundreds of millions of people are doing transactions, that is a lot of bandwidth - each must know all, or a substantial part thereof.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasonably, Satoshi replies with this:\n",
      "> Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day.  Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.\n",
      "\n",
      "> The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.\n",

      "I want to point something out about this conversation: Satoshi does not dispute James Donald’s point that a fully deployed network at the time of publication would not be possible… he simply states that in the future it will be possible because of optimizations and technological improvements. I believe that neither are right, but Satoshi was just slightly closer to being correct. Close enough to pique the Hal Finney's (creator of RPOW) interest and the rest is history.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Some other notes that I’ll be working on incorporating into a final draft of this**: Based on email provided by Wei Dai to gwern, Satoshi was known to contact Adam Back and Wei Dai before the posting on p2pfoundation or on the Cryptography mailing list. It’s interesting the lack of knowledge that Satoshi displayed regarding prior art: it seems he didn’t know about b-money, RPOW, or bitgold at the time he was directed by Adam towards the b-money concept.

The reasons for this are complicated and discussed below. But obviously, the community needed the ability to keep adding new users. So some long-term developers (including me) got together and developed the necessary code to raise the limit. That code was called BIP 101 and we released it in a modified version of the software that we branded Bitcoin XT.\"\n",

      "I think one big issue is that some people who were arguing for 1mb in the past came up with the node count as a reason to not increase the blocksize. The number of bitcoin nodes hasn't fallen from 10K+ to 5k because it's costly to run a node at 1mb. It is very cheap to run a node for the majority of the users. Marginal cost almost 0. More or less the same for 4mb. The reason people are not running nodes is because they don't care. It's the same thing as GHASH, people will run nodes when they feel we are REALLY too low. They will only care if they see an imminent danger/warning. It's a little bit of hassle to run a node: human being are extremely lazy, just forwarding a port for example or letting your computer run 24/24 is a roadblock. The hassle again is more or less the same at 1mb or 4mb. At way higher size, you could have a node on a barebone for a few hundred bucks. This is nothing, we have thousands of people holding 5-8 figures in $ of bitcoin. They could spend much more than that on running a node if they had to. So I think this argument is counterproductive because easily dismissed. Everytime I hear it, I feel like if it's all that you have, then let's do it. But I suspect there are much stronger arguments to be made, so I would like to hear about them. That's why I'm posting here.\n",

      "\n",
      "I understand this is part a political decision, people (business, bitcoin holders) are worried about Bitcoin's adoption and future viability. Maybe they should just wait patiently.. But on the other hand if 4mb is not a technical problem then why not accomodate them ? It's not like we are anywhere near mainstream adoption, it's not impacting a fundamental characteristic of Bitcoin either (decentralisation, scarcity, fungibility -which is still lacking a bit-). If you think it's impacting decentralisation, then can you please lay out clear arguments once again?\n",

Several of Mike's concerns are actually addressed in newer cryptocurrencies. Decred has better bottom-up governance. His own XT has larger block size limits. Bitcoin itself is talking extensively about scalability, not just increasing the block size limit but also more fundamental and difficult, yet less politically charged, changes. Litecoin, monero, and ethereum all employ egalitarian proof of work, making Chinese or other monopolies quite harder to achieve. Bitcoin is a large experiment, and even if bitcoin itself as a currency fails, others will take its place.

      "\n",
      "The way things currently work (without Opt-In RBF), you send a transaction, the miners collect it, and they'll presumably add it to the block they're mining. If the block is full, they'll prioritize the highest-fee transactions. If your transaction doesn't make the cut, it'll have to wait until the next block. If blocks continue to be full, your transaction might continue to not make the cut, and it could end up in limbo this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miners currently (presumably) follow a First Seen Safe policy, which means if they see another transaction trying to send the same coins, they're going to prioritize whichever transaction they saw first.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this is completely up to the miner's discretion. There is no way for anyone else to figure out whether a particular transaction was replaced. So, if a miner sees two transactions attempting to send the same coins, but one has a higher fee, the miner has the incentive and ability to replace the lower-fee transaction with the higher-fee one in order to collect the higher fee, and there's nothing stopping them from doing that.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the status quo. Full RBF already exists, if miners decide to use it. The software doesn't do that off-the-shelf, but any miner could modify their software to do this, and the protocol does nothing to stop it, as far as I understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what does \"Opt-In RBF\" change? Well, it gives you a way to tell the miners if you want them to do RBF or not. In terms of enforceability, it's just a suggestion. Like the pointless \"Do Not Track\" feature browsers have, it just tells the miner what your preference is. It isn't really opt-in RBF, it's opt-out RBF, with RBF having effectively been the default all along. And, unless there's something I'm not understanding (which is very possible), miners can continue to do full RBF whether you opt in or not, or regardless of whether you're using a client that \"supports\" Opt-In RBF.\n",

Customers would send coins to addresses where BitPay or CoinBase are the required signers to release coins, and when the coins are to be released BitPay or CoinBase would sign the transaction once and only once.  This would ensure that merchants taking transactions with zero-conf can trust that a customer cannot try to spend again because BitPay and CoinBase would refuse to sign another transaction from the same address.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make this system trustless, the address in question would have a time lock of a day or two.  After the time lock expires, only the owner of the coins would be able to spend the coins while the second BitPay or CoinBase signature would no longer be required.  Thus, if CoinBase or BitPay cannot or will not sign a transaction to release the coins, at worst, a customer can recover his coins when the time lock expires.\n",

      "It's easy to feel resentment at this stage, having done so much work and written so much high-quality code, and yet getting a shitstorm for it. When I was leading the Swedish Pirate Party into the European Parliament, I was gradually getting used to getting a barrage of criticism grenades for everything I did and didn't do every single day, starting with when I did or didn't get out of bed in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "**It's very hard to explain what this does to your psyche to somebody who hasn't experienced it.** Imagine everybody was out to get you, every single day, and giving you high-pitched screaming blame for everything from an orange being round to some Mongolian guy's utter misinterpretation of what you said three years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not exaggerating when I say that people could probably snap and go restraining-shirt-insane for much less.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the crucial thing when you're in a leadership position like that, getting criticism for absolutely everything, is to maintain your ability to sort the relevant criticism apart from the back seat drivers who make a living out of complaining but not contributing. You've also got to trust your inner compass of the vision you want to accomplish.\n",
      "\n",
      "From what I can tell, Core has made the common but crucial mistake of isolating itself from the community and taking on an expert attitude toward everybody else in trusting this inner vision compass over external criticism, where Core is somehow right by definition - the development happens as Core wants it, period. This is very dangerous in any open-source / free software project. Other people are just as intelligent and may have considerable experience and ability to evaluate the claims made, and these should - no, must - be taken seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "To illustrate just one point, let's take a look at Core's scaling solution here, Segregated Witness.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I apply my nontrivial experience in coding and systems design - I started coding 37 years ago - I see these two options for scaling bitcoin near-term:\n",
      "\n",
      "**OPTION ONE** - Change the blocksize upper limit to two megabytes. One line of code for the constant, about ten LOCs for activation trigger logic. Requires upgrading of a majority server software.\n",
      "\n",
      "**OPTION TWO** - Introduce Segwit. About 500 lines of new code, of which at least 100 in the hypersensitive consensus code. Requires upgrading a majority of server software _**and all** client/wallet software and client/wallet **hardware,** especially those needing to pay money to an arbitrary address_ (as Segwit introduces a new type of address).\n",
      "\n",
      "When proponents of Core's scaling tell me that Option Two here is the better _because it's safer_, and I try to comprehend that statement, I am either utterly insane or the statement is the equivalent of \"black is white and up is down\". It's just not completely counter to all experience in software engineering risk management, it's so far out it doesn't reflect sunlight anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I try to understand more and challenge the assertion that option two is _safer_ - on what I must say are very good grounds - I'm told that I should be leaving design to the experts and that I don't understand enough of the complex machine that is bitcoin. I know I am capable of learning complexities, but I am firmly told off from even trying.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's just not how you succeed in maintaining a community. That's not how you make people want to run your code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, people are free to run whatever code they like. But the checks and balances in an open source community is simple: if the leadership for a project builds something different from what people want to run, they will run something else. It's therefore in the interest of the leadership to listen to the community to understand what software a majority wants to run. These competing interests provide the checks and balances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I understand the complexity of block transfer times through the Chinese firewall and that preliminary tests indicate that a typical full node is saturated at a blocksize of 32 megabytes. However, none of these limits will be hit by this particular scaling. Also, when blazing a trail like this, you work one problem at a time, you solve one bottleneck at a time. People have been flagging for the necessity of increasing the blocksize for ... I don't have dates here at hand, but it should be the better part of a year if not more. Further down the road, scaling node throughput capacity can be done in a number of ways from GPUing ECDSA to specialized hardware, but it's not the imminent bottleneck.\n",
      "\n",
      "When such an enormous amount of crucial data (on the need to raise the blocksize limit) is ignored, that is done at the peril of the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "People in the bitcoin community are intelligent geeks, capable of inhaling absurd amounts of information and cross-referencing all of it. If you are unable to explain why your solution is better than another proposed solution, people will be utterly dissatisfied with the response \"because we are the experts\" - for you must assume that other people in the community, in the general case, are at least as intelligent and capable of learning as you are. It's even possible that if you can't explain your solution to an open and intelligent mind, it's not a good solution.\n",

      "\n",
      "# Some advice for Classic and supporters\n",
      "\n",
      "So it appears the hard fork is happening. A lot of people have fought hard to raise the blocksize limit for a long time, using a variety of means, and it seems to be happening at long last.\n",
      "\n",
      "Core didn't take the last available opportunity to include a blocksize limit lift in 0.12, but have announced the release candidate without that feature. So this is it, this is when the fork happens or doesn't happen. Right now, based on announced support, the fork appears to be moving forward. A lot of people supporting Classic are feeling a lot of relief, even if people know that this effort is not done until the blocksize trigger has activated on the network. It's far from there at this point - there's not even deployed code. But everything seems to be going the right way.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to reflect on how this is more than a discussion on features. This is an election of what people decide get to _decide_ on the features, direction, quality, and vision _moving forward._ And as Satoshi declared, there's only one thing determining the outcome of the election: what code is producing the longest chain. That's how bitcoin's democracy works, right there.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not a selection of features. It's much bigger than that. It's an election of governance and stewardship into the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "As in most elections, there has been a lot of animosity - in both directions. As heels have been dug in, ditches turned to trenches, and preferences turned into prestige, people are starting to call out each other and accuse the other side of not working for what's best for bitcoin, and actively naming specific names in negative contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "When those in power do this to you, you're feeling everything in the book between resentment, belittling, and outrage. It's easy to do the same thing back. There have even been suggestions that Core is deliberately sabotaging bitcoin to the benefit of ... a selection of actors.\n",
      "\n",
      "This creates a toxic culture leading up to the election point, where people are afraid to take bitcoin-positive initiatives in anticipation of all the negative attention that follows - for in such an environment, practically all attention will be negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "It doesn't help that people incumbent in positions of power tend to \"do what they must, because they can\" in order to safeguard the status quo, however small or insignificant that incumbency is - this includes everything from Theymos' deletion of discussions, via the silly DDoS attacks on XT nodes, to LukeJR's poison pull request to Classic about killing all miner hardware investment. Actions such as these are not really excusable, but they are still human: people tend to do **the very human mistake of letting the ends justify the means, with the ends being what _they_ believe is best for the bitcoin network.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, other people disagree of what's best for the bitcoin network, and toxicity follows until the conflict is resolved. And beyond. The toxicity will _remain_ until actively removed by leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "**It is the responsibility of the winner in any rift to end a toxic animosity culture of hostilities and personal adversarialism. I cannot stress this enough.**\n",
      "\n",
      "History is full of examples where the winners refused to live alongside the losers and rebuild the world together once the conflict was resolved. It never ends well. On the other hand, where the opposite has been true - South Africa's end of segregation with Mandela as president comes to mind as a good example of leadership here - people learn to put animosity behind them.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of people who have submitted code to Core (and previously) are skilled coders, after all, working from their vision. This vision doesn't have to be incompatible with Classic's vision in the slightest - it may just be a matter of slightly different feature priorities, with people intending to get everything in there anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "(I'd also therefore like to praise Jonathan Toomim for not engaging in the rifting but focusing on _solving the problem_ to most people's acceptance. Real MVP right there.)\n",

      "# Finally, some personal reflections\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, I believe bitcoin development has lost touch with large-scale rollout necessities over the past year or so. At the moment, there are three use cases which all new features should seek to improve:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Remittance.** The act of sending money between individuals in different countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Drop-in credit card replacement,** from the perspectives of both the payer and the merchant (two different use cases). This means that a payment must be instant, easy, and much cheaper than a credit card settlement.\n",
      "\n",
      "These three use cases must be front left, right, and center when doing any design on the bitcoin network, as far as I'm concerned. They also reinforce each other when funds received by remittance don't have to go via fiat to be used for purchasing something.\n",
      "\n",
      "**If there's no profit to be made in using bitcoin as a drop-in replacement for credit card payments, bitcoin will not be deployed at scale. Deployment and outcompeting legacy systems depend entirely on merchant financial gains from rollout. The story begins and ends with this observation.**\n",
      "\n",
      "That's why I'm concerned when I'm looking at the features of 0.12. I don't see any features targeting one of these three use cases. Fact is, I see at least one feature severely degrading the drop-in capability of credit card replacement - RBF - and the lack of scaling severely jeopardizing, not to say ultimately removing, the profitability in replacing credit cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I see is instead engineering for the sake of engineering. The question of \"who's the customer?\" seems to have gotten lost in the process. While it's arguable that there's no customer as such in an open source project, there's nevertheless an importance in understanding where the _front bowling pins_ are for a disruptive technology like this - and it's certainly not in the one-time initialization time of starting up a new node. I'd argue that the front bowling pins instead are the three use cases I listed above, and would love to see a stronger focus on tangible use cases moving forward even if people disagree with my choice of cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Onward and upward. Bitcoin will recover and move on. Let's learn from this experience.\n",

      ">And surely, it is important that we should know how to listen without making a tremendous effort to understand. When we make an effort to understand, our energy goes into the effort rather than into the process of understanding. Very few can listen without resistance, without creating barriers between themselves and the speaker; but if we can put aside our particular opinions, our accumulated knowledge and experience, and listen easily, without effort, then perhaps we shall be able to understand the nature of the fundamental and radical transformation that is so essential in a crisis of the present kind.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Now, it is obvious that there must be some kind of change. We are at the edge of a precipice, and the crisis is not limited to a particular group, religion, or people, but it is a crisis that involves us all. Whether you are an American or a Korean, a Japanese or a German, a Russian or a Hindu, you are affected by this crisis. It is a world crisis, and to understand it fully, if one is at all serious about it, one has obviously to begin with a fundamental understanding of oneself. The world is not different from each one of us. The world's problems are your problems and mine. This is not a histrionic assertion but an actual fact. If you examine the matter closely, go into it fully, you will see that the collective problems are the problems that confront each one of us individually. I do not think there is a division between the collective problems and those of the individual. The world is what we are; what we are, we project, and that to us becomes the world problem.\n",
      "\n",
      ">So, to understand this extraordinarily complex and ever-increasing problem that we see in the world, we have to understand ourselves - which does not mean that we must become so subjective, so inward-turned, that we lose contact with external affairs. Such an action, such a process, is meaningless, it has no validity at all. But if we can see that the world crisis - the confusion, the tragedy, the appalling murders and disasters that are taking place and are going to take place, this whole beastly mess - if we can see that all this is the result of our own daily life and action, of our particular beliefs, both religious and national, if we can see that this world cataclysm is a projection of ourselves and is not independent of us, then our examination of the problem will be neither subjective nor objective, but will come about through quite a different approach.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Now, we generally approach a problem of this kind either objectively or subjectively, do we not? We try to understand it either on the objective or on the subjective level, and the difficulty is that the problem is neither purely subjective nor purely objective, but is a combination of the two. It is both a social and a psychological process, and that is why no specialist, no economist, no psychologist, no follower of a system, whether of the right or of the left, can ever solve this problem. The specialists and experts can attack the problem only in their own particular fields - they never treat it as a total process - and to understand it, one must approach it in its totality. So, our approach to the problem can obviously be neither subjective nor objective, but we must be capable of seeing it as a total process.\n",
      "\n",
      ">To understand the world crisis as a total process, one has to begin with oneself. Outwardly there is constant war, conflict, confusion, misery, and strife; and through it all there is the search for security, for happiness. Surely, these outward problems are the result, the projection, of our own inward confusion, conflict, and misery. Therefore, in order to solve the external problems, which are not independent of our inward struggles and pains, we must obviously begin to understand the process of our own thinking; that is, there must be self-knowledge. Without knowing ourselves fundamentally, both the conscious and the unconscious, there is no basis for thinking, is there? If I do not know myself deeply, at all the different levels, what basis is there for my thinking, for my action? Though this has been said over and over again by every preacher since the beginning of time, we go on disregarding it because we think that by environmental change, by altering outward circumstances, by bringing about an economic revolution, we can transform fundamentally the process of our thinking. But surely, if we can look at the problem a little more closely and ardently, we will see that mere external alterations can never bring about a fundamental revolution. Without understanding the whole process of the self, of the 'me', the process of our own thinking, the inward confusion in which we live will always overcome the cunning reconstruction of outer circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      ">So, it is important, is it not, for those who are really serious, who are in earnest, who are not just flippant or pursuing some sectarian belief - surely, it is important for such people to begin to understand the process of their own thinking. Because, after all, our thought is the response of our particular conditioning, and there would be no thought if there were no conditioning. That is, whether you are a socialist, a communist, a capitalist, a Catholic, a Protestant, a Hindu, or what you will, your thinking is the response of that conditioning; and without understanding that conditioning or background, which is the 'you', whatever you do, whatever you think, must obviously be the response of that conditioning. So, to bring about a fundamental revolution, a transformation in oneself, there must be the understanding of the background, of the conditioning influences which create the process of thinking; and this self-knowledge is the beginning of wisdom.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Most of us, unfortunately, seek wisdom through books, through listening to somebody; we think we will understand life by following experts or by joining philosophical societies or religious organizations. Surely, they are all escapes, are they not? Because, after all, we have to understand ourselves, and the understanding of oneself is a very complex process. We do not exist at only one level; our structure of being is at several levels, with different entities all in conflict with each other. Without understanding that whole process of the self, we cannot finally solve any problem, whether political, economic, or social. The basic problem is one of human relationship, and to solve that, we must begin to understand the total process of ourselves. To bring about a change in the world, which is obviously essential, we must be aware of all our psychological responses, must we not? To be aware of our responses is to observe them without choice, without condemnation or justification - just to see the whole process of our own thinking in the midst of relationship, in the midst of action. Then we begin to examine the problem in its totality, that is, we are aware of its full scope; and then we shall see how our responses are conditioned by our particular background, and how those conditioned responses are contributing to the chaos in the world. So, self-knowledge is the beginning of freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Now, to discover anything, to understand what is truth, reality, or God, there must be freedom. Freedom can never come through a belief; on the contrary, there is freedom only when the conditioning influences of belief, and of the process of memory, are understood. When there is that understanding of its own process, then the mind is really still, spontaneously silent; and in that silence, which cannot come through any enforcement, there is freedom. Then only is there a possibility of discovering what is real. So, there can be freedom only with the understanding of the self, of the 'me', of the whole process of our thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      ">There are some questions, and in considering them, may I suggest that you and I should both try to discover the truth of the matter, and not merely wait for an answer. Life has no categorical answer of yes or no. We must go into each problem very deeply, and to go into it deeply, we must begin very near and follow it closely without missing a step. And if we can take the journey together and discover the truth of these problems, then no expert, no pressure of public opinion, no immature thinking, can ever obscure that which has been discovered.\n",

      "sergiodemianlerner 5:29 PM Regarding SegWit, I don't know if you have actually looked at the code but the amount of code changed, including consensus code, is huge. (maybe ~500 lines). I think such change has never been attempted in the history of Bitcoin. We cannot just say lightly that a couple of weeks after the 2mb hard-fork we're going to deploy segwit. That code needs months of review. Also I'm against the complexity of segwit as a soft-fork (probably requires 200 additional lines of code of consensus critical code). Segwit almost prevents consensus-compatible re-implementations of Bitcoin in other languages.\n",
      "\n",

      "There is the possibility in the near future that an artificial fee market develops and a severe backlog of transactions happens. When that occurs, transactions will be pushed off the network. Maybe they are spam transactions. Maybe they are transactions that go to another place such as paypal or another coin. When there is a severe backlog of transactions you have the problem of unreliability. When does your transaction confirm? Maybe it's 1 hour. Maybe it is 5, using your wallets best guess. That's probably the point of opt-in RBF... so you aren't stuck.(There are some reports of businesses using the network already experiencing these kind of problems and we aren't even in the severe backlog days)\n",
      "\n",
      "The classic team is (for the better part of my knowledge) releasing code at the end of January where it will be in review for 2-4 weeks and then deployed where the activation happens 2-4 weeks after that. So You could have a double in transaction capacity by sometime in March.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segregated witness on the other hand has gone live on the test net. Some estimates say that once it is deployed (I heard April, but maybe sooner?), that its deployment will take a year afterward for all the software required to use it. If it is fully 100% deployed and everyone uses it then it will give us an effective capacity of 1.75MB (Still less than the hard fork option).\n",
      "\n",
      "The point is that if the network has the capacity now to do something it should take the better short term can kick. It makes more sense to slow Segregated witness down. Test it more, and think about doing it as a hard fork instead of a soft fork. Sure, SW has other benefits besides increased transaction capacity. Like fixing malleability. But in the short term, not kicking off some people who transact with bitcoin, not scaring future investors because of how \"inflexible\" bitcoin is and not stalling growth is a smarter move. There have been many people lately who have warned about this. Stalling growth, premature optimization... things like this can have effects that can result in slower growth and increasing popularity of alternatives. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, there is that issue of hard forks. I hear a lot of people defending the core developers and saying that they plan to hard fork after segregated witness at some point. The argument against hard forks gets stronger over time. If they won't do it now when there are people clamoring for it then why would they ever do it?  Keep in mind that soft forks are just as powerful as hard forks and that they could in the future hack a solution using something called \"extension blocks\" to keep the network going.\n",

If you have a client generating segwit transactions they will be counted as about half as big regardless of how many other people have upgraded.\n",
      "\n",
      "That means people who use upgraded wallets will immediately be able to get the benefits of SW. That might hasten deployment faster than some think. But it also probably means people with hardware wallets and less informed users are SoL.\n",

I even agree with these statements.  That conversation with Toomin was facepalm worthy.  But I simply can't understand then why Core is so damn hardheaded about this issue.   The blocksize proposals have literally come as low as they can get.  It started at 20mb increasing over time to 8gb in the future, then dumbed down because China said 8mb was the best they could do, then it shrank again, then again, and now people are simply asking for a 1mb increase to handle the current increase in traffic and move us forward.  Yet to JUST get this compromise we are still forced to hard fork *both the development and the blockchain.* Everyone says how bad it would be to do this and yet *core has not given a millimeter in this so called \"compromise\"*!  \n",
      "\n",

      "The Core developers have it *entirely* in their power to prevent the move to classic and the risk of having someone like Toomin be in charge of anything.  All they have to do is prove that they will listen to the community and the miners.  If they increased the blocksize themselves, to the widely agreed upon and clearly not bandwidth straining size of 2mb, **this issue would be over.**\n",
      "\n",
      "If the hard fork comes, and the Toomins turn out to be inept and there is some blatant problem with no developers to work on it.  I'll find it very difficult not to be mad at Core for letting it happen when the power to prevent it was literally laid in their lap.  If Core wants to stay, prove it by actually listening. \n",
      "I have been saying for a long time that I believe politics, not mining fees, will ultimately sustain the network past the days of meaningful block rewards. I believe if we have a successful hard fork then we have moved one decisive step closer to this reality. \n",

      "The costs associated with sustaining the network ultimately represent voting power over the future design of the network.

      "*Power* is the heart and soul of money, it is appropriate that power lies at the foundation of the Bitcoin system. Once it becomes clear how important having a vote in the future of the network becomes, and that control of the instruments used to sustain the network are the key to having this vote, then profit ceases to be the sole incentive for mining or running nodes. The larger and more consequential the network becomes globally, the more the incentive moves from profit to politics. And that will happen precisely in line with the decline of block rewards. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the currency becomes powerful, mining fees will not be necessary. If the currency is extremely valuable, the network will be sustained purely so powerful parties can dictate its future. Those parties may be nation states, those parties may be masses of individuals, it is not clear, but miner fees will not be a necessary incentive as having voting power becomes the greater concern. \n",
      "\n",
      "This nature of Bitcoin, the fact that it is open to political capture and control, will actually make Bitcoin *more* trustworthy as a global system, not less. The reason there is trust in modern central banking is because of the impression that their command structure ultimately derives from a democratically elected government. To the ever increasing extent that people understand that these institutions are not really democratic at all, and representative more of the banking system than of the government, trust is eroding. Trust, the foundation of money, lies in part in the perception that the system is fair. \n",

      "More important, trust in a monetary system depends on the perception that that monetary system exists for the benefit of your people. Trust in national currencies stems from trust in national governments which are clearly meant to represent the people of the nation.

Digital currency experts from the People's Bank of China, Citibank and Deloitte & Touche engaged in a discussion and exchange regarding several topics including overall frameworks for the issuance of digital currency, national digital currency in the context of current currency developments and state-issued cryptocurrency. People's Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan attended the meeting, with People's Bank of China Deputy Governor Fan Yifei chairing the meeting. The meeting was also attended by experts from related research institutions, major financial institutions and advisory bodies.\n",
      "The meeting pointed out that as information technology has developed and technologies such as the mobile Internet, trusted and controlled cloud computation, secure terminal storage and the blockchain have matured, significant changes in payment methods have occurred world-wide and the development of digital currencies presents both opportunities and challenges to the issuance of currency by central banks. The People's Bank of China has taken this subject seriously, establishing a special research team as early as 2014 and further bolstering said team in the beginning of 2015. The team has since conducted in-depth research on various subjects, including frameworks for the issuance of digital currency and related business operations, key digital currency technologies, environments for the issuance and circulation of digital currencies, legal issues faced by digital currencies, the effects of digital currencies on the economic and financial system, the relationship between fiat digital currency and privately issued digital currency and international experience in the issuance of digital currencies.\n",
      "The meeting stated that under China's new economic normal, the exploration of the issuance of digital currency by the central bank has positive practical significance and far-reaching historical significance. The issuance of digital currency can reduce the significant costs of issuing and circulating traditional currencies, improve the convenience and transparency of economic transactions, reduce money laundering, tax evasion and other criminal acts, enhance the central bank's control of over the money supply and currency circulation, better support economic and social development and aid in extending financial services to under-served populations. Going forward, the establishment of a system for issuing and circulating a digital currency will help China build an entirely new financial infrastructure, further improve China's payment systems, improve payment and settlement efficiency and promote increased overall economic quality and efficiency.\n",
      "The meeting urged the People's Bank of China's digital currency research team to actively incorporate important results and practical experience from digital currency research performed within China and abroad as well as continue to advance their work on the basis of their preliminary work, establish more effective organizational safeguard mechanisms, further clarify the strategic objectives of central bank digital currency issuance, thoroughly research key technologies, research various applications for digital currency and strive to introduce a digital currency issued by the central bank as soon as possible. The design of the digital currency should be based on sound economic, safety and service principles, ensure a low cost of use for the digital currency and wide coverage, achieve seamless integration of the digital currency with other payment tools and enhance the usefulness and vitality of the digital currency.\n",
      "While moving forward with research into digital currencies, the People's Bank of China has established communications channels with relevant international agencies and Internet companies and has conducted extensive discussion with domestic and foreign financial institutions as well as traditional card-based payment operators. Both Chinese and foreign nationals who participated in the discussions take this work very seriously and conducted in-depth exchanges with experts within the People's Bank of China system regarding related theoretical research, exploration of applications / practice and development pathways.

But ultimately, under either scenario, the system will be stronger for it because we will have learned more about how the Bitcoin protocol would work in a 1MB blocksize scenario with full blocks and upward transaction fee pressure or a 2MB blocksize scenario with greater pressure on miners and nodes.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of what decision is made on the blocksize limit, the community can always correct its mistakes if it is determined that there is a more optimal solution.  But we can't be afraid of simply taking a position, and sticking to it for the short-term to see how it plays out.  I'm pretty sure the price of Bitcoin won't tank to zero.  It might go down a lot, or it might go up a lot, but it won't spell the end of Bitcoin overnight.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There seem to be two options.  We can either raise the blocksize to 2MB or we can keep it at 1MB.  But either decision should be made with the  clear caveat, that NO DECISION IS PERMANENT.  Neither of these decisions will kill bitcoin overnight nor will the community irrationally stick to that decision if it appears  it was a mistake.  The only thing that will kill bitcoin overnight is if everyone decides to sell and quit.  \n",

It's a choice about creating a new paradigm, or staying trapped in an old paradigm.  People are free to come and go as they please.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, you could argue that there are other alt-coins and blockchains that offer a better paradigm, but none of those other alternatives have anywhere close to the market value of bitcoin.  For better or worse, bitcoin has created millions of individuals who have a vested interest in their pocketbook for it to succeed.  \n",

The players at the top, the bitcoin brain trust, need to realize that both sides of the blocksize debate make good points.  However, they also have to realize that nobody actually knows the future of either scenario, because nothing like Bitcoin has ever been tried before.  \n",

      "All I know is, regardless of the decision, Bitcoin will survive long enough to correct any mistakes from that decision-- if there are any.  We just need to accept this reality, and change the perception of our debate.  It's not life or death.  It's not all or nothing.  It's not \"Mike Hearn is a traitor.\"  It's not \"Bitcoin Core devs are hi-jacking the system.\"\n",

      "Ultimately, a 1 or 2 MB blocksize will not alter the fundamentals of bitcoin.  A 2MB blocksize will show us what sort of impact a small blocksize increase has on the # of nodes broadcasting transactions.  It will also show us if a small blocksize increase has any impact on the economics of mining.  Yes, some nodes may drop out, but a lot of nodes will continue to process transactions because miners also run nodes, and miners have a vested economic interest in bitcoin.  This will be very important for us to observe and measure if we decide to go with a 2MB limit. \n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, keeping the blocksize at 1MB will show us how transaction fees are impacted by completely full blocks.  It will show us how a transaction fee market might develop by keeping the blocksize limited to 1MB in the face of increasing transaction volumes.  It will show us the types of users that put the most value on super fast transactions that confirm in 10 minutes or so.  This will be important to observe and measure if we decide to keep the limit at 1MB. \n",

      "Neither a 1MB or 2MB scenario  is a must.  The only thing that has to be done is to humble ourselves and allow the process to play out.  No one has all of the answers.  We need to learn a lot more about the economics of bitcoin before we can firmly decide whether the blocksize should be always be increasing or if there should always be some sort of rigid limit.  But the only way that's going to happen is if we accept that a decision must be made.  Once we accept that, we need to prepare to diligently measure the impact of a 1MB or 2MB limit on the system, take notes, discuss, and then reevaluate.  \n",

This in turn is in the interest of anybody holding bitcoin. \n",

At that time, the promise of a subsidy can be withdrawn.\n",

When talking about Bitcoin Classic's releases, Jeff stated that a hard fork is needed for the upgrading and improvement of the source code(the original Chinese are weasel words and possibly syntactically incorrect), yet(and) without providing a clear long-term roadmap(about what lies ahead of the 2MB increase?), which led to almost universal dissatisfaction(correction: the author later edited his article to change the \"almost universal\" to \"some\" , apparently due to a protest from one attendant who did not disapprove) among those present, whom further expressed their withdrawal of support for Bitcoin Classic, and the need to reach a wider consensus within the community before a decision can be made.\n",

In his frame of thought, he's likely to see money, in the traditional sense (for things like in person purchases), as only one potential, and quite trivial, application.  But he won't see that application as what Bitcoin *is*. \n",
      "\n",
      "An economist is more likely to not actually *see* Bitcoin for what it is and, therefore, make a judgement about its utility in the market based on one narrow application (traditional payments).  He or she may even make quite perplexing comments  like \"we already have credit cards for that\".  \n",
      "\n",
      "An economist is liable to catch the \"digital gold\" metaphor and immediately stop reading further, due to their own prejudice or bias.  Even if they're correct in their opinion on gold, its completely irrelevant because gold is, yet again, just a helpful metaphor for the unimaginative.  And it's a metaphor for one application (store of value), nothing more.  \n",

      "A developer envisions Bitcoin's potential for international remittances.  He or she partners up with a friend, and founds a company like Abra.  And, for the economists in the crowd (like a Krugman), Abra is only possible because of Bitcoin's P2P, decentralized nature.  To put it simply, \"no\", this cannot be done with credit cards (but it's a nice thought).  A developer envisions Bitcoin's potential for micro-transactions, to pay per article (new sites), remove ads, etc.  A developer envisions Bitcion's anti-spam potential.  Imagine if every email, one day, required an attachment of a single satoshi?  For the typical worker, sending 100 emails per day, it would be insignificant.  But for spammers, it would bankrupt them.  Extrapolate.  A developer might envision \"smart contracts\", contracts essentially written in code, that are deterministic and trust-less.  API micro-services.  Machine-to-machine transactions.  Injection into any environment where market dynamics (supply/demand) aid in resource allocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A developer acknowledges that there is a spectrum of potential applications, only a fraction of which have been realized.  Some will never be realized, and many more will be unexpected.  Anyone is free to debate the utility (or lack thereof) of any of these applications, and others, but they aren't free to immediately dismiss all of them as 0.00% probability events.

      "So if you look at [the current state of the bitcoin network]( We have approximately 220000 transactions over the last 24h. That's 2.5tx/sec which is pretty much near the maximum capacity of the network considering the 1MB cap, but lets not talk about that here. If we look at what our beloved miners received from the system for securing our transactions (~1,500,000USD), that means we have paid them around 7USD per transaction. Now, the mining business isn't exactly a good business, they don't actually make a huge profit out of mining. Which mean that 7USD is pretty close to the price they paid for the equipment, maintenance and electricity cost. Now it's going to be difficult to infer what is the actual ratio of this costs, but if we assume a very conservative 20% for electricity. That's about 1.4USD of electricity. If again we take a conservative price (to try to reduce the kwh/tx!) of 0.1USD/kwh. That's about 14kwh of electricity per transaction. To be honest, this is a very conservative estimate. Probably it's 2-3 times this. \n",

      "   \n",
      ">It was the observation of a new \"line\" that has become popular with those responsible for \"central banking\" functions relating to national currencies that gave us the idea for the theme of \"asymptotically ideal\" money.\n",
      "    \n",
      ">The idea seems paradoxical, but by speaking of \"infla-tion targeting\" these responsible officials are effectively CONFESSING that, notwithstanding how they formerly were speaking about the difficulties and problems of their functions, that **it is indeed after all possible to control inflation by controlling the supply of money** (as if by limiting the amount of individual \"prints\" that could \n",
      "be made of a work of art being produced as \"prints\").\n",
      "    \n",
      ">This popularity of the line of \"inflation targeting\" seems to have started in New Zealand, which is the place, among the USA, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, which had the most depreciated dollar. And we can note also that New Zealand was hardly a place where any crisis of poverty really forced them to not maintain the value of their dollar but rather just a place where \"Keynesian\" thinking was probably very influential. \n",
      "    \n",
      ">If now we think of a world of a number of major curren-cies and with all of these provided by central authorities that operate under some sort of a ritual of \"inflation targeting\" then, as things evolve, what SHOULD the targets be?\n",
      "    \n",
      ">It is only really respectable that there should not be an arbitrary or capricious pattern of inflation, but how should a proper and desirable form of money value stability be defined?\n",
      "\n",
      " >Rapid inflation is easily measured, on a national level, by a domestically defined \"cost of living\" index. So if the cost of living, as measured by another agency than central banking authorities, were not rising (when expressed in terms of the domestic money) then one could feel assured that there was not inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      " >However this requirement is actually a little too strong (for a properly good money worthy to be called  of \"ideal\" type)! It is actually quite natural for the calculated \"cost of living\" to be rising, even when meas-ured, say, in terms of gold, whenever there is so much technological progress that the people in an area, without working harder, are lifted to a higher standard of living by the rapid progress, as if each human would become the beneficiary of the assistance of 3 robot helpers to do the work of his livelihood.\n",
      "    \n",
      ">So in the last years of the era of the gold standard the \"cost of living\" measures were gradually rising, in “advanced countries”, but it was not appropriate to view that as indicating inflation since the money was not losing value in relation to alternative options for \"treasure hoarding\", (such as gold!).\n",
      "    \n",
      ">**To be quite respectable, in a Gresham-advised sense, money needs only to be AS GOOD as other material commod-ities that might be hoarded.** It does not really need to be so good (as time passes) that the cost of living statistic should remain constant.\n",
      "    \n",
      ">But \"inflation targeting\", **unless all major currencies would (somehow!) be able to be adopting and really employ-ing the same target rate**, would still provide the oppor-tunity for \"connoisseurs of quality\" to rank the currencies in hierarchies of gradations of quality (like bond rating agencies rank the debt of commercial enterprises or like other rating agencies comparatively appraise various insurance companies). Those really having lower planned inflation rates would naturally be seen as superior in quality. (**We should note that the INTERNATIONAL perspective relating to a currency is not how it relates to domestic-ally measured costs in its home country but how it compares, on the international markets, with other currencies and commodities.**)\n",
      "    \n",
      ">**What inflation targeting does is to open up the possib-ility that somehow the various major currencies may evolve to develop stability of value.

My argument is that by not increasing the block size (allowing full blocks / dropped transactions / high fee transactions) you destroy many startups using bitcoin in the process and they are the ones hosting many full nodes already, so by not raising the block size you wil actually **reduce** full nodes and **increase** centralisation!\n",

If there is no blockchain transaction capacity increase, they will have no choice but to move their entire business model onto the next most secure blockchain just to operate with reliability, taking their full nodes with them. That is one example of literlly hunderds. So there goes 1000 full nodes just like that.\n",
      "Let's crowdfund a actual rocketship to the moon, set up a couple nodes for our space friends who want to do business with us earthlings.

      "According to the usual narrative, there is a trade-off between decentralization and block size. Actually, the whole ongoing debate revolves around this trade-off. In this post, I will convince you that there is no trade-off at all and that we can actually have both.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most commonly used metrics for decentralization is the number of full nodes in the network. Larger blocks makes it more expensive to run a full node, thus one can expect the ratio of users who do so to decline. However, larger blocks also mean that the system can support more users. For example, if half of all the full nodes give up when blocks increase to 8 MB in size, it would still be a win for decentralization as there would be four times as many transactions and thus also approximately four times as many users. Under these assumptions, a block size increase to 8 MB would double decentralization as measured by the number of full nodes in the network. The key question to ask here is: what percentage of users would give up their full node when running one gets more costly? Are some critical levels to be aware of, i.e. the typical throughput of a tor connection? (According to [tormetrics]( it takes about 10 seconds to download a 5 MB file at average, so there does not seem to be an immediate bottleneck.)\n",
      "\n",
      "A similar argument can be made for the other popular decentralization metric, the distribution of hashing power. Larger blocks allow for higher total fees per block, and thus more total income for miners and thus also more hashing power in the network, which increases security. As long as it stays below a few seconds, block propagation time is a secondary concern and overshadowed by other economic factors, such as the variation in electricity prices. For example, if electricity prices vary 20% between locations, this completely overshadows the benefit of getting the latest block 6 seconds faster, which increases expected revenue by maybe 0.01 BTC per block (1% of fees), or 0.04% of income (0.01 BTC / 25 BTC).\n",
      "\n",

      "* **Protocol improvements** (SegWit)\n",

      "-------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the logic of the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rolling out networking improvements will make it safer to increase the block size—even if you don't believe that there is a danger, it will at the very least render those fears silent; thus, it makes sense only to do a hard fork after improvements to networking:\n",
      "\n",
      "* networking improvements; then a hard fork.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, a single hard fork at the end of any sequence is a way to introduce cleaner implementations of the already-deployed protocol features—not just implementations of something like SegWit, but implementations of *anything* else; *a hard fork is an excellent time to clean up Bitcoin*.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, this alone implies that its best to perform a hard fork after getting SegWit up and running for a sufficiently long period of time, so that a cleanup effort can account for observations made during real-world usage; hence:\n",
      "\n",
      "* protocol improvements; then a hard fork.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, a protocol improvement like SegWit will potentially tax the network with greater throughput, so it could be argued that networking improvements should be deployed before SegWit:\n",
      "\n",
      "* networking improvements; then protocol improvements; then a hard fork.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, tuning the parameters of networking improvements such as IBLT/weak-blocks/thin-blocks implementations is still a matter of ongoing research, whereas SegWit is nearly ready to go; furthermore, it is useful to give SegWit ample time to deploy, so as to get real-world feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, Bitcoin Core devs have decided it's best to get SegWit out the door as soon as possible; all of their effort has been put into SegWit before turning much attention to networking improvements, especially since SegWit will provide a much-desired increase in throughput and  may influence the implementation of networking improvements; effectively, Bitcoin Core has decided *internally* on the following order:\n",
      "\n",
      "* protocol improvements; then networking improvements; then a hard fork.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, such an order is not necessarily known to be strictly required; other groups could pick up the slack with the effort to improve networking at the same time.\n",

      "**This yields the final, logical ordering:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **protocol *and* networking improvements; then a hard fork.**\n",

      "As a bonus, the intervening time between now and a hard fork may allow for observing how the Bitcoin ecosystem responds under some kind of maximum load, thereby revealing greater knowledge about how to improve the system.

      "\n",
      "So, lurking around in here, it seems like you guys think Bitcoin could go to the moon, or 1000 USD. That seems like it's *really* far away, considering the [current price is ~399 USD]( Also, it seems like you currently view Bitcoin as a *really* volatile investment rather than a currency, since you are really happy whenever the price goes up, and kinda shrugs when it goes down. That means we can use normal stock evaluation tools to look at Bitcoin. That's where my BA project comes in.\n",
      "\n",
      "My project is about pricing options, and a part of that is forecasting stock prices. I'm doing that by following the Monte Carlo process outlined in [Wikipedia](  As you can see, we need a volatility and µ. However, µ is defined to be the riskfree interest rate, and over a year, that's currently [0,47%]( The volatility can be read on WolframAlpha, and over the last year, that comes out to [51% over a year]( By pluging all that into the formula on Wikipedia, we get a sample path for the value of Bitcoin. One such path is seen [here]( and another is seen [here]( As you can see, really volatile, just like real life Bitcoin. You could argue that the first is unrealistic, because people might not want to get back into bitcoin once it hits 300, but that's besides the point.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to get back on track, what I did then was to put in a check to see if my model Bitcoin hit $1000 and then run the simulation 50000 times. The result, when running using 341 days, because that's what's left in the year, was that it hit 1000 in 3512 of them, or 7,024% of them. Not necessarily staying there, mind you. Just hit it. However, if we are a bit less ambitous with our \"moon\" wishes, and say 750 is good enough, we get 9570 hits, or 19,14% of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "To put those numbers into perspective, 538 puts the odds of [Hillary winning the Iowa election at 82%]( and Kasich winning in New Hampshire at 9%, which means the odds of both happening is 7,38%, better than the odds of Bitcoin hitting 1000. If we stay on the political scene, 538 puts the odds of Bernie winning in Iowa at 18%, which is only slightly worse than the odds of 750 BTC\n",

I’ve seen all the booms and busts, but I’ve always been able to keep my eyes on the fundamentals, and seen them getting stronger year after year. However, what’s happening now with the Bitcoin Classic’s hard fork proposal, is making me doubt the whole value proposition of Bitcoin. It has absolutely nothing to do with the content of the proposal (having 2MB blocks would be just fine IMO), and everything to do with the fact that it’s seemingly possible to gain industry support for a hard fork, which triggers when only 75% of the miners support it.\n",

Requiring a near unanimous miner support (at least 95%) for a hard fork now, will set a precedent that will protect YOU, when someone with a strong political campaign tries to hard fork Bitcoin into something YOU don’t like.

      "Peter Todd recently [posted a description]( of tests he ran to see how easy it is to successfully double-spend bitcoins. Because he was able to execute double spends successfully against a large number of popular wallets using a Python script he wrote, Peter claims to have shown that:\n",
      "\n",
      ">“With the above in mind, deployment of opt-in RBF will have zero effect on users’ vulnerability to double-spends.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter's tests do not establish this, due to his security model not incorporating the probability of double-spends.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The argument**\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter sets up his post with:\n",
      ">“A common criticism of Opt-In Replace-by-Fee (RBF) has been that we need to give the ecosystem more time to implement detection of opt-in RBF transactions, arguing that if we don’t users will be put at a significantly greater risk of being ripped off by malicious double-spends. For this criticism to be valid, user and merchant wallets must already be able to detect situations where a transaction may be maliciously double-spent, and warn their users appropriately. On the other hand, if they can’t do that, then opt-in RBF doesn’t change the situation anyway: an attacker doesn’t need to use it anyway to rip people off, and when wallet authors fix that they can trivially add opt-in RBF detection anyway with one or two lines of code.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This analysis ignores how Bitcoin Core’s support of RBF could change the amount of double spending attempts. It matters how likely double spend attempts are before and after RBF, not just whether they both meet some binary threshold of difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Could Core’s support for RBF make double spending easier?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine these two scenarios:\n",
      "\n",
      "Scenario #1: A user who wants to double spend must seek out and download a special version of an open source wallet which incorporates the double spending logic in Peter’s Python script. The user must transfer some coins to that wallet address, then use it to double spend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scenario #2: A user who wants to double-spend needs to open the latest version of the wallet that they’ve always used, then use a UI which allows them to attempt double spends via RBF transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be clear that attempting a double spend as described in Scenario #2 is easier than in Scenario #1. How do we know that this won’t lead to more double spend attempts? \n",
      "\n",
      "We can all imagine a determined double-spender who would not be deterred by having to go through the process Peter described in his tests. However, it’s possible that many double spends will come from people just trying out some double spending for kicks, who may then do more of it if they succeed. Users who are curious to try double-spending may also be wary of downloading a wallet from an non-trusted source, whereas they wouldn’t worry about using an option in a well-known wallet like Electrum or Mycelium which they already use.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Doesn’t this only apply to wallets before they add RBF detection, which is trivial to add?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. It is technically pretty easy to add this check. However, as Peter confirmed in his tests, wallets have traditionally not protected themselves very well or quickly against 0-confirmation double spending. It’s unclear how quickly they’ll add RBF detection. If there is a delay between when some mainstream wallets integrate RBF support and when some merchants are checking the RBF flag on transactions, these merchants could see their double-spend losses increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, i supported XT, and then a 2mb increase, (because every agrees that slow confirmation times and large fees are bad), but realized that those weren't long term solutions anyway, and far enough from perfect that it makes more sense to just try segwit first-why not?

Even the most ~~reckless~~ hopeful blocksize growth numbers don't come anywhere close to matching those TPS figures.

      "Abstract:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The maximum block size (miners can create) is raised to 32MB.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Nodes can specify the maximum block size they’ll relay. It can’t be lower than 1MB and the value is publicly announced.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Miners navigate between the risk of being orphaned and losing on transaction fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 95% Activation threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Motivation:\n",
      "\n",
      "Miners are motivated by the bitcoin they mine on each block. The revenue is split between block coinbase reward and transaction fees. Greed will push miners to increase the size of the blocks to make more on transaction fees. Fear of the blocks not propagating fast enough will prevent miners from creating blocks that are too big.\n",
      "\n",
      "The maximum relay value of each node is public. Miners have the duty of researching and analysing the network of bitcoin nodes. They have to determine the right block size to minimise orphan risk and increase profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specification:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The maximum block size is set to 32MB.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The minimum relay value is 1MB. The maximum is 32MB.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The bitcoin client can automatically determine and adjust the relay value based on the host bandwidth capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The operator can set the relay value to a fixed amount, but not lower than 1MB.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The relay value is publicly advertised to other nodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rationale:\n",
      "\n",
      "= Chinese miners\n",
      "\n",
      "Most nodes are located in the western world. Most of the hashing power is located in China. It’s possible that a 32MB block that is generated in France, for example, gets propagated quickly through the western world (most of the nodes). \n",
      "\n",
      "However, Chinese miners won’t be able to download and relay this block. So they’ll mine on another chain with smaller blocks. The network will eventually fork. But the western nodes will adjust again to the chain which has the most proof of work.\n",
      "\n",
      "This can be a possible attack surface on the network. Nodes can mitigate against this attack by lowering their relay value below their hardware capacity to adjust for the Chinese miners.\n",
      "\n",
      "= Insights into the network capacity\n",
      "\n",
      "By making the relay value public, economic operators and miners have a valuable insight into the network capacity. \n",
      "\n",
      "Miners will decide the size of blocks they create based on this data. There will be less conflict (and arguing) on how much the network can support.\n",
      "\n",
      "= The maximum throughput of the network\n",
      "\n",
      "This proposal assumes the Segregated Witnesses Soft-fork is deployed. The maximum number of transaction the network could handle would be around 20 million transactions per day. (assuming widespread use of Segregated Witnesses in the future).\n",
      "\n",
      "A 32MB maximum size will give much more leeway than a single 2MB increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "= Resolving the block size conflict\n",
      "\n",
      "- Nodes will be able to cast their vote and determine the network capacity. There will be less speculation on how much the network can support.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Nodes will, voluntarily, compromise for China lack of bandwidth to stay on the chain with the most proof of work.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Instead of working on multiple implementation, software developers will work on a single implementation and leave the upgrade decision to the network.\n",
      "The strategic move here is simple, and it pretty much prevents any other implementation from dethroning Core for the foreseeable future. As an example, here's how Core can make sure Classic can never gain a foothold:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Counsel an exchange like Bitfinex to set up [fork-futures trading]( for Classic's proposed fork, where investors can buy and sell future coins (call options) on the Core side vs. coins on the Classic side. The trading would commence well in advance of the proposed fork.\n",
      "\n",
      "2a) As long as Core is winning in the trading, do nothing. Core's position is safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "2b) If Classic is winning, simply announce that Core will raise the blocksize limit to 2MB in 3 months. Classic will lose and again Core is safe. \n",
      "\n",
      "Note that this could even be refined further: if Core wants to wait a year for a blocksize increase, it could announce that instead and check how the futures market reacts. If Core pulls well ahead on that announcement, Core could rest assured that they can stay more in line with their preferred roadmap without risking their dominant position. (You might say, \"What if things change during the year and people again itch for a fork?\" Then futures trading would start anew, and Core could reassess in the same way, always maintaining its leading position with minimum compromise.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if that announcement is not enough to pull ahead in futures trading, Core could change it to 9 months or 6 months, testing the market's reaction each time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Result: Core makes the absolute minimal changes necessary to retain its position. It doesn't risk overreaching and losing its reference implementation status, and it doesn't under-reach by compromising on its vision too much in an effort to please the market. All because it has the best tool available for ascertaining the market's reaction *in advance* - a futures market.\n",
      "I'm not trying to raise an argument, just trying to stay informed. From all angles segwit looks like a fantastic solution to a controversial problem. If so, what are the opponent's debate points? Is it just that it's not enough? Or is it a stubborn \"No! We want 2MB right meow!\" kind of deal?\n",

      "Edit:\n",
      "From what it seems is that on the large part SW is agreed upon by everybody. The major opponents are those who still want their hard fork to 2MB now because they think SW will prevent that (even though that's part of core's way ahead). There are those that think that core is just using this as a too little too late fix for not increasing the size earlier. Also coupled with those who are afraid that a 2MB increase could cause a DOS against those miners. Also, the security issue from those who don't immediately upgrade.\n",

      "Bitcoin is something that can be used to sync money and all sorts of information in a global database. We don't know if that can be cheap for the long term but we will try and extend that concept using currency inflation and expanded supply of space for sale for as long as possible. It's difficult and expensive to control your own money fully but you can choose from some providers who help you control it which should hopefully keep it pretty accessible for most people. The tradeoff for that convenience is that those people who help you use Bitcoin get to represent you when making changes to Bitcoin, although you can always just stop using Bitcoin.\n",

      "Bitcoin is a stable and reliable currency ledger that makes a limited set of promises and avoids risking people's money through as strong as possible security guarantees.

      "\n",
      "If Bitcoin is used by everyone right away what will happen is that it will work as it does today, but running the servers that power Bitcoin will become more and more expensive. It will be similar to email: everyone will just look at some ads and let a company mine their data a bit in exchange for access to the Bitcoin network and sacrifice of control of how it works. It will still be possible for an individual to run their own server, but over time it will be pretty impractical and difficult to do it anonymously or in a way that can't be easily shut down by a powerful attacker.\n",

      "If Bitcoin is used by people right away, the network will become expensive to transact on directly but it will remain cheap to be a peer to peer node with no outside dependencies, practically anyone will be able to do it without major expense. Since the node will remain cheap and have a low footprint, it will be difficult to attack and easy to use fairly anonymously. As the network becomes expensive to transact on this will create a market opportunity that provides alternatives to the network, limiting the growth of network expense and providing a range of cheaper or more convenient alternatives.\n",

      "Bitcoin should be used as a permissionless alternative to PayPal and other money transmission services. Businesses can set up money transmission businesses without quite as much legal hassle and people can use a low cost way to send money or other long term stored information to each other in ad hoc ways.

People can then keep their money in Bitcoin with the assurance of gold that it will retain its limited nature as well as fungibility and other essential properties, but with the convenience and flexibility of modern digital fiat currencies.

With such a technical feature in place, hard data on consensus changes can be aggregated and made public. Without such a feature, a lot of energy is expending arguing about opinions.\n",

I've seen many comments from devs that hard forking is really hard, takes a really long time, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Think about it. If you were going to design a globally distributed network that has no central control and could only be hard forked smoothly if everyone agreed, the **first** thing you might think about doing would be setting up a really clear method of communication amongst nodes about future consensus changes. In addition, you really want to be able to ignore actors who are not generally supportive of the smooth and functional operation of the bitcoin vision.\n",

      "BIP9 (versionbits) works really well for establishing when the network is collectively ready to soft fork in features that are in the running code but not activated. \n",

      "\n",
      "I assert that this is a suboptimal design, and that all bitcoin node software should implement a standard I'll call BIP9-hard that allows users to edit config files, or command line arguments, or knobs in the GUI in order to communicate responses to upcoming consensus issues. Responses to specific questions can be a lot more useful than opinions on reddit, slack, youtube, medium, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, an effective set of questions is:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Do you now have enough bandwidth, or are you willing/able to upgrade your bandwidth to support 8MB blocks?\n",
      "2. If you are not willing/able, what is the blocking factor? Money or lack of availability?\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A closely related issue to this data based discussion capability is that community is currently in the dark regarding soft metrics around network health.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **How many nodes have been abandoned?** There are nodes running old, insecure versions of bitcoind. Are they still running because someone forgot to show down a VPS on their company's network, or are they supporting a wallet or an application that requires that version? This distinction is extremely important. In the former, that node can be hard forked off the network with no loss to anyone. In the latter, a benign community might work to find out how to get that node back on an intelligent upgrade path and avoid imposing a hard fork on that node.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd venture that no one in the bitcoin community who wants to see it succeed would argue that a forgotten and unused VPS running an old version of bitcoind should be a reason to not give bitcoin that awesome upgrade coming down the pipe that requires a hard fork. Right???\n",
      "\n",
      "So no amount of awesome technical wizardry thrown at creating a consensus Q&A platform will help if the node operators are asleep at the wheel or are running nodes they forgot about.\n",
      "\n",
      "This leads me to believe that Bitcoin needs a node operators guide that deals with this weakness. e.g. in all the places where there are instructions on installing bitcoin nodes, make it explicit that if you set and forget a bitcoin node install, you're running 100% risk of that node ceasing to operate as intended due to a hard fork. In addition, if you go dark for X months in terms of responding to upcoming consensus polls, you loose the right to complain if you get forked off the network. Communicate people, communicate!\n",
      "\n",
      "The only way to know that node operators are paying a minimum level of attention is that they are running a recent version. There's no way to prove that they aren't paying attention if they are running an out dated version on their node(s).\n",
      "\n",
      "Let this be the basic principle: It's effectively impossible to operate a consensus network where the consensus rules are dynamic without establishing a highly effective communication method about change of consensus.\n",
      "\n",
      "**This would not be a problem if Bitcoin consensus was set in stone from the early days. If it never changes, no one has to talk about change. They only run a node and transact on the platform or they don't.** \n",
      "\n",
      "I think that if Bitcoin doesn't get behind the basic principle I laid out, it will likely not realize its full potential and will continue to generate a lot of traffic on reddit. :)\n",

Anyway, there is this ponzi scheme company, Bitclub, that is opening meetups in various cities \"educating\" people on bitcoin. But what they're REALLY doing is selling a cloud mining ponzi scheme. Here's the story:\n",
      "\n",
      "Someone opened up a bitcoin related meetup in my area -  and I joined. Then, one of their people contacted me. I have a small physical storefront devoted to bitcoin, and he said he was real excited about this, wanted to meet me, blah blah. But then he started spewing stuff about cloud mining and telling me shit that I knew was factually incorrect. And that's when I knew something was up. Also, he was giving me the whole \"hard sell\" over the phone, he just wouldn't take no for an answer. I finally hung up on him because he was a complete idiot. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I decided to attend the meetup the following Monday. I was the only one there. Some other guy, obviously a sales rep, came and was telling me how great cloud mining was blah blah and trying to get me to join this \"bitclub\" thing. He too, didn't know what he was talking about. He didn't even know what the blockchain was! I later left because the meetup wasn't fun, the guy was an idiot, no one was there, and I didn't want to deal with his hard sell tactics. \n",

      "I hate shit like this. One of the things I really liked about the bitcoin community is the whole hippie/hacker element to it and I hate it when shit like this fucks up the vibe. So I informed the guys at meetup.com about this, hopefully they'll shut them down. But there are others in other cities, so please be aware of this. If anyone out there experienced this, please inform the proper authorities (whether it be meetup.com, or potential \"recruits\", or the authorities or whatever). \n",

      "I plan on putting a warning on my company website about bitclub, because I feel the company is misleading people and a lot of people are going to be suckered out of a lot of money.

      ">\n",
      ">Horace and Pete is a new show that I am producing, directing, writing, distributing and financing on my own.  I have an amazing cast: Steve Buscemi, Edie Falco, Alan Alda, Jessica Lange, Aidy Bryant, Steven Wright, Kurt Metzger and other guest stars.  Also Paul Simon wrote and performed the theme song which is beautiful.\n",

      ">The response to episode one has been great so far and there are more coming.  We are making them now and having a lot of fun doing it.\n",
      ">\n",
      ">Part of the idea behind launching it on the site was to create a show in a new way and to provide it to you directly and immediately, without the usual promotion, banner ads, billboards and clips that tell you what the show feels and looks like before you get to see it for yourself.  As a writer, there’s always a weird feeing that as you unfold the story and reveal the characters and the tone, you always know that the audience will never get the benefit of seeing it the way you wrote it because they always know so much before they watch it.  And as a TV watcher I’m always delighted when I can see a thing without knowing anything about it because of the promotion. So making this show and just posting it out of the blue gave me the rare opportunity to give you that experience of discovery.\n",
      ">\n",
      ">Also because we are shooting this show in a multi-camera format with an emphasis on a live feeling, we are able to post it very soon after each episode is shot.  So I’m making this show as you’re watching it.  \n",

If you’re on this email list then you’re probably aware that I always make an effort to make the work I do on my own as cheap as possible and as painless as possible to get.  That’s why my specials are five dollars and that’s why I sold tickets to my last big tour here on the site, with our own ticketing service at a flat price with no ticket charges and we have worked hard to keep my tickets out of the hands of scalpers.  \n",
      ">\n",
      ">So why the dirty fuckballs did I charge you five dollars for Horace and Pete, where most TV shows you buy online are 3 dollars or less?  Well, the dirty unmovable fact is that this show is fucking expensive. \n",
      ">\n",
      ">The standup specials are much more containable.  It’s one guy on a stage in a theater and in most cases, the cost of the tickets that the live audience paid, was enough to finance the filming.  \n",
      ">\n",
      ">But Horace and Pete is a full on TV production with four broadcast cameras, two beautiful sets and a state of the art control room and a very talented and skilled crew and a hall-of-fame cast.  Every second the cameras are rolling, money is shooting out of my asshole like your mother’s worst diarrhea.  (Yes there are less upsetting metaphors I could be using but I just think that one is the sharpest and most concise).  Basically this is a hand-made, one guy paid for it version of a thing that is usually made by a giant corporation.\n",
      ">\n",
      ">Now, I’m not complaining about this at all.  I’m just telling you the facts.  I charged five dollars because I need to recoup some of the cost in order for us to stay in production.  \n",
      ">\n",
      ">Also, it’s interesting.  The value of any set amount of money is mercurial (I’m showing off because i just learned that word.  It means it changes and shifts a lot).  Some people say “Five dollars is a cup of coffee”.  Some people say “Hey! Five dollars??  What the fuck!”  Some people say “What are you guys talking about?”  Some people say “Nothing. don’t enter a conversation in the middle”.\n",
      ">\n",
      ">Anyway, I’m leaving the first episode at 5 dollars.  I'm lowering the next episode to 2 dollars and the rest will be 3 dollars after that.  I hope you feel that’s fair.  If you don’t, please tell everyone in the world.  \n",

      "Can LN be seen as 0-conf (or -1 conf) txns but with trustless^2 guarantees?\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now most funds are locked in singlesig wallets and we hold private keys (to have math guarantees) to be able to access our funds in the future. Now imagine funds being (time) locked in shared multisig wallets and we store mutually signed multisig transactions to be able to access our funds in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the vision of Lightning Networks: We get instant payment verification, better fee utilization and better privacy by trading off timelock of funds. By exchanging^1 mutually signed multisig transactions *off-chain* - in a trustless way - we \"change\" which funds everyone can (eventually) access.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enforcing these txns on the (relatively slow and expensive) blockchain is then only necessary to resolve disputes or to relocate funds to different multisig wallets. Since everyone can time-lock some funds and act as trustless intermediary this should - in theory - naturally lead to decentralisation. Small hubs benefit of higher channel throughput *velocity* which leads to higher *fee pay-off* utilization of the locked-up funds. I.e. **Everyone will become a LN hub!** :) \n",
      "\n",
      "The transition can be done gradually by slowly migrating to shared multisig wallets and postponing the publication of transactions. As long as we have signed txns that we *could* use anytime to \"get\" all our funds there is no need to do it immediatelly. There is also no need for trust since the funds can not be spend otherwise^2 without our signature. While we don't need our funds they earn us some money by helping others^1 to use txns more efficiently and save fees. Much of the involved complexity can be automated and transparent to the user interface. You simply make a payment - faster, cheaper and more private.\n",
      "\n",
      ".\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) I omitted how atomic trustless multi-hop txns work in detail. Also there are *many ways* to find \"cheapest\" paths for routing payments over multiple hubs. But even without any routing - i.e only single payment channels - it can already help shift significant load off the blockchain. The gains can then be increased gradually by developing more sophisticated routing schemes.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) The trustless math guarantees are only *almost* as strong as direct on-chain txns due to the timelock trade-off. Signed off-chain txns are overridden with decreased locktime for them to becomes valid before previous ones in order to change access to shared multisig funds. This introduces a new risk of not publishing a transaction in time in case a counterparty defaults. Instead of making sure to (automatically) watch the blockchain this risk can be insured with a smart contract: sth like \"If you see a certain txn on-chain then make sure another txn gets published in time. If you fail then compensate me the lost funds.\"\n",

When we talk about bitcoin's market cap being pretty minuscule in the grander scheme, generally that market cap is referenced, but it could actually currently be much much smaller. If 3 million BTC were lost in the early days for example, the current market cap of Bitcoin would really only be around $4.5 Billion. A big difference from the current quoted market cap.

Their so beloved block reward would be worthless and they’d be forced to update.

      "The topic of how SPV mining is bad has come up several times in the last year. There was a [recent proposal]( to demand that miners prove that they have received all of the contents of a block before they can start mining. There have been various proposals in the same spirit over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think making miners prove they have the full contents of the block they are trying to build on is a bad idea, because it puts miners at a disadvantage if they cannot rapidly acquire the entire block contents. This task favors centralized players with high bandwidth, low latency connectivity, which is expensive, and the problem gets worse the larger blocks get. Players with poor connectivity will fail to mine profitably because too much of their time will be spent receiving and validating each block.\n",
      "\n",
      "A similar benefit could be achieved without the negative centralization impact if the miners are asked to provide evidence that they validated a block far enough in the past. For example, if miners were required to provide evidence that they validated a block at height H - 4 when mining the block at height H, then you have a situation where there is a 99.9% chance that the block at H - 4 will have been broadcast more than 250 seconds ago. On average, miners would have 30 minutes to receive and validate the H - 4 block.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not know exactly what kind of evidence the miners should be asked to provide. It would be nice if the evidence had the following properties:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Showed that they actually validated the block, not just that they knew it. Alternatively, it could maybe just take a similar amount of time as validation takes, so that there is no temporal cost to validating in parallel.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Verifying the evidence would not add much time to the overall block validation step.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Verifying the evidence would not be necessary to perform the rest of the block validation. Like with segwit, nodes could skip this verification if they wanted to.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Was hard to outsource. For example, perhaps the proof could incorporate the header from block H-1, or some of the intermediate mining steps that would only be accessible to someone who was about to solve the block.\n",
      "\n",
      "The above idea could be implemented with a soft fork, and would create incentives that would practically guarantee that miners would would validate every block as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would not absolutely enforce that behavior, so theoretically miners could construct a chain 3 blocks long on top of an invalid block before they were forced to prove knowledge of the bad block. I think this would be incredibly unlikely if the above idea were implemented because the cost to behave \"properly\" would be negligible, and if you misbehave you risk losing a lot of money.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what if such a chain were produced?\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, unless the network is deploying a soft fork, fully validating nodes would not accept the bad block and would not notice the bad chain. As I understand it, the fact that SPV nodes do not validate blocks could cause them to follow this bad chain, however this vulnerability could be improved with a simple fix. When validating nodes serve blocks to SPV nodes, they would include a message to indicate that they have personally validated the block. SPV nodes could be configured to consider a block \"provisional\" until several nodes indicate that they have validated the block.\n",
      "\n",
      "***\n",
      "\n",
      "My first reaction to this issue was that SPV mining did not present a big problem because miners are incentivized to validate as soon as possible, and discard blocks or chains when they discovered they were invalid. I have changed my mind this weekend and suggest making the changes described above. What I realized, is that while SPV mining is pretty harmless during normal operation, it can be disastrous during a soft fork.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider this scenario:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A soft fork is being rolled out, and whatever threshold of miners has been reached. Blocks that do not conform to the soft fork are officially considered invalid.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. An un-upgraded miner produces a block that is valid according to the old rules, but invalid according to the new rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Even though they indicated that they were ready for the soft fork, a large fraction of the miners are just SPV mining, not actually validating. They do not notice that this block does not obey the rules of the soft fork and they build on it. Call this chain B for bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Un-upgraded nodes cannot notice that these blocks are \"bad.\" They see these blocks as confirming transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Miners who have upgraded, and are validating, reject the longest chain and continue working on the soft fork. Call this chain G for good.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Upgraded nodes follow chain G.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. The network therefore experiences an unplanned hard fork between chain B and chain G. Eventually all miners will switch to one of the two chains, but it cannot be known ahead of time which chain will win. This is pretty much a worst case scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the above, part of the personality of a soft-fork becomes more clear to me. During a soft fork, it is impossible for fully validating nodes, if they are not upgraded, to determine whether or not they are on the correct chain. This puts almost all of the power and responsibility on the miners. If they mine without validating during this delicate phase, no one else is positioned well to correct their mistakes. Un-upgraded nodes are effectively turned into SPV clients -- not just for transactions making use of newly rolled out features, but for the question of which chain is valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ideally, miners would:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Receive the solved header for H - 1\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Start mining H with no transactions\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Receive a compact message that allows them to include at least some transactions while mining H.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Receive the main block H - 1 absent the SW and do a complete (provisional) update of the UTXO state. Prioritize transactions and start mining a full block.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Receive the segregated witness for H -1 and fully validate the block.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Discard the current block and roll back the utxo state if you have discovered that H - 1 is invalid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forcing miners to validate prior to hashing could cause most miners to **stop validating at all** and outsource the validation job to specialists with low latency internet connections, much like how high frequency trading is done on computers that are physically located close together. This is not a good idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why is introducing anything that allows miners to \"make progress\" toward solving a block a deadly sin, but this proposal, which allows certain miners (especially the one who solved the last block and already has it and knows that it is valid) to get a head start is a-ok?\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Lots of reasons but here are some logistics:\n",
      "\n",
      "First we have to assume they like the story, believe in Bitcoin and have a buy in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically the super rich do things in a different and more complex way than normal people -- they will have an investment department in thier family office and a Chief Investment Officer, a head for Private Equity, venture, real estate, hedge funds and so on -- when you have $20 billion for example....even if you put half a billion freakin dollars into each investment....that's still a whopping 40 investments you have -- (and no one does that anyway)\n",
      "\n",
      "That means if there is a monthly board meeting by phone, say twice yearly in person reviews or meetings and say, 10 pages of analysis a month to read on each investment then that's 80 flights and 400 phone calls and 4800 pages of information to read a year.....and that doesn't even include emergencies, a CEO dying, a lawsuit, managing the investment staff, listening to 10,000 pitches etc etc ----- so basically you need a mess of staff.   \n",
      "\n",
      "The investment managers are called all day, every day...not just by Joe Sixpack the local financial advisor, but by Lloyd Blankfein and Henry flippin Kravis.    Then JP Morgan comes along with a preferred client fund that only the top management and a tiny number of select clients can invest in....now you have 41 investments.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And this is at $500 million a pop.  People don't do that on $20 billion -- even on $700 billion sovereign wealth funds they are often in the $100 million range.  That's huge, even for giant investors.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Joe the genius hedge fund star leaves Apollo and starts his own fund -- his track record is awesome and you like him and know that if you support him on his first raise you'll always be welcome....so what do you do? Give him $500 million?   Hells no.  No one would do that -- as Chief Investment Officer you will give $1 mil or 5 or maybe 25 mil to a new fund if they really love the guy...but if it's 25 mil then you will want part ownership in the actual fund and a board seat.....now you have two more investments,  the fund and the fund company.\n",
      " \n",
      "To top this off -- how do you track all this?   You have the investments split between the family charity, and some in offshore vehicles for that since its tax free but then mirror funds in the US with taxes some funds are not even originally domicile in the US, many have no daily valuation ....sometimes the investments with XYZ PE Fund are actually over 3-4 funds from that company.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now you have 200 investment statements coming in every month.  How do you organize it?  Expensive software that doesn't integrate, data entry etc...another half time employee. They are at different banks, custodians, some are illiquid etc.   When the time for performance reporting comes how do you track it all etc. and especially considering taxes.  When you need money for the new London townhouse you sell something that has gone down to balance some earlier gains but it's in two different entity ties and three different jurisdictions.  You have layers of trusts and corporations and holding companies holding various investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now if you are a family office manager you also are handling everything from jet charters to security personnel to buying junior a new house to suing the reporter who lied about rhe boss to finding the rare part for a 1962 Porsche and auditing the house manager of the home in the Alps because you suspect he's been cooking the books on household expenses.  At 10pm on Thursday the boss calls and needs $400k for a rare Beretta shotgun he found on vacation in Itally - here's the auction house number, get someone to call, speak Italian, get it done, get it insured and make sure it's legal to ship from Italy and to the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investment team meets weekly,  meetings with the boss are monthly but also many special trips -- visits to the bank, due diligence on companies etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Add Bitcoin to this mix-- it's weird, odd, you don't have any custodian that your team recognizes who will accept it.  They don't know what department it should be under, who's responsibility to manage etc.   They decide to take a position, do some due diligence on XYZ Bitcoin and go with them -- the bean counters go visit XYZ and you hire an auditor and a security consultant to make sure it's as secure as they say ....this all takes a couple months.   Then the Chief Investment Officer calls his pals at XYZs lead investors and gets an intro to the CEO and after some paperwork and verification gets XYZ to agree to a million a day instead of $50k maximum....but to do this XYZ needs blah blah legal form and an audit or whatever....this is a pain for XYZ btw because they don't know for sure the client will actually buy and they don't make a huge amount relative to the work but they are great and make it all work out.  Your internal legal council needs to change the holding co because he's concerned about obscure liability issue and your tax accountant has a list of other concerns.  Your estate attorneys have you in for 7 meetings to discuss if Bitcoin can be added to the Grat or your old obsolete family limited partnership and they determine the cold storage needs multi-sig this needs legal agreements etc.  Finally it's all done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yay.  Now we can buy Bitcoin.  We buy a million dollars worth.   The bank calls and freaks out because they saw $1 mil and \"Bitcoin\" - they temporary lock the account.  You yell at them, threaten to pull business and finally Mr. Big calls a board member and the CEO fixes it with apologies ....that takes 7 days.   Now you start again, you buy a million a day every weekday for three months, we need a trader to do all those buys and it takes hours a day to try to get the blocks without moving the market.  You get another $30 mil from big block purchases from Binary, miners etc.  You do all this while trying to not be noticed, not have anyone mention your name etc because the boss wants to be low profile.   \n",
      "\n",
      "You bring in accountants and experts and learn about cold storage remembering that everything is bigger, different and harder for zillionaires.  Also when you hire PWC to check this out and recommend security systems etc. - they are not going to risk their relationship with a big client by messing around...they will charge $100k and have a comprehensive analysis done.\n",
      "\n",
      "So now you have $100 million in Bitcoin.   Moon!  BTC goes to $1200 per coin in a year!  Yay!  Much win.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guess what?\n",
      "\n",
      "On your $20 billion portfolio that gained 12% that year.....even after all this time and this incredible luck of Bitcoin tripling in value.... it has accounted for only 1/12th of your gains for the year....basically a months interest on the overall portfolio.\n",

      "No manager thinks it will triple.  If they estimated a crazy pie in the sky of 50% return then you are looking at a week's worth of interest to buy something that's experimental and very risky.\n",
      "\n",
      "So -- overall -- Bitcoin has gone from inaccessible, to Dwalla to Gox to now great models like Coinbase & Circle.   If you are a rich dentist, no problem.   If you are a very rich business owner and want to buy $10 mil worth...a little effort and you can do so.\n",

Perhaps I may have set the title of this post to be misleading. As it is in no way a challenge, setting up a full node is super easy. There is one rule though, do not host new full nodes in the cloud such as that ran by Amazon or Microsoft. It is preferable to setup the full node on your own network. Reason why is because if majority of nodes were hosted under one of the major \"cloud providers\" it would allow that company to do a sybil attack on the network.\n",

      "A couple of weeks ago I published a project for an art nude photography book on kickstarter. Some people contributed but I wasn't able to reach the goal. To be fair, the goal was pretty high and the deadline to reach it was too short. So at the end of the deadline the goal was not reached.\n",

      "It was my first time using kickstarter, so I had no idea what I was doing. I was just sort of experimenting with it to see what would happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that experience there were two things that really caugth my eye. One: Kickstarter keeps a 5% processing fee and Amazon takes another 5% if the project gets funded sucessfuly.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first I thought that was fine. After all, kickstarter was finding me investors for my project. But then something happened that seemed unfair to me and it's the second thing that bothered me about the experience: Kickstarter actually told me to promote my project among my friends on social media so I could get more funding.\n",
      "\n",
      "What?\n",
      "\n",
      "So let me get this straight: Kickstarter wants to charge me 5% -and Amazon another 5%- for the money I can get just by asking my friends and followers on social media?\n",
      "\n",
      "What do I need kickstarter for then?\n",
      "\n",
      "Again to be fair, kickstarter did provide a few contributors without me having to ask my friends. Had the project been successfuly funded, it would've been 100% fair that kickstarter recieved a 5% \"finders fee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I thought: why doesn't Coinbase or Circle compete against kickstarter using bitcoin?\n",
      "\n",
      "Coinbase could set up a system for people to fund projects with bitcoin and only charge the 1% comission for converting bitcoin to dollars or to any other local currency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1% fee alone would be enough to attrack people.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, if you want to contribute to my project you can check it out here: \n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I'd much rather get it funded through Coinbase (no fees), so if you feel like contributing with bitcoin the best way to do it is to open a Coinbase account and send the coins from the account to blogdeizquierda@gmail.com so I can be aware of who sent the coins and I can contact them to send them a reward for their contributions. The rewards would be the same as the ones in the kickstarter project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in order to make this fair, I propose the following: If I do not reach the funding goal at kickstarter, then I will give back all of the bitcoin donations from coinbase. If I do reach the goal, then I will send the rewards in the same amount of time as stated in the kickstarter description.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, to make it fair, if I receive a contribution of less than 25 dollars, which is the minimum contribution on kickstarter, I will return the contribution to the sender unless the sender specifically states he does not want any reward in exchange and whishes to contribute a smaller amount anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, and only because this is a nude photography book (nothing explicit, although there is full frontal nudity), I need to find a way to verify the age of the contributor. In theory, all Coinbase users who want to buy or sell bitcoin are supposed to be at least 18 years old unless their parents provided written consent to Coinbase for their kids over 13 years of age to use the service. But wallet users who just want to send and receive bitcoin don't need to verify ID. That creates a problem, as the only way for me to verify age is through an ID. So the only way I can deliver the rewards to contributors is by requesting a photo of the contributor with an ID without sensitive information (deleting home address and ID number), just showing name and date of birth. I know this is cumbersome but I really can't think of any other way to figure out somebody's age without looking at an ID or without receiving payment through a credit card. I'm open to suggestions, though. The only way I wouldn't need to look at an ID is if the contributor stated he does not want a reward at all, but I don't think that would be fair.\n",

      "Anway, I hope this makes sense. My point is, if I'm going to be the one finding people to fund my project, I shouldn't give kickstarter 5% and another 5% to amazon. And the only way I can see that working is through bitcoin.\n",

      "It's very important that fungible alt coins (e.g. Monero) thrive, because this will greatly limit the ability of elites to abuse Bitcoin holders and users. Holders will be abused by discounting their holdings as not \"blessed\" and users will be abused by rent seeking activity on the \"blessed side chains\". Sounds a like crap that goes on in our current fiat currency world.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, if they abuse the Bitcoin holders too much, then the holders can move to fungible alt coins, set up their own side chains and invite the users over as well. In fact, this will not be a one off, but a dynamic process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The absolute opaqueness of a truly fungible alt coin will slow down such a process, but once a truly fungible block chain is seen as trustworthy and a better alternative to Bitcoin, then the process may become unstoppable. After all, users don't care about opaqueness or privacy, they just don't like getting screwed.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are just some observations, based on my attempts to make sense of this mad story that is unfolding before us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitcoin at its base layer, the Bitcoin blockchain, is relatively stagnant and closed to innovation. I must stress my use of the word ‘relatively’ here, because of course the Bitcoin protocol of today is indeed different to that of 2009. The fundamentals, however, remain the same. This isn’t a bad thing at all. Gaining consensus necessitates that any changes are uncontroversial, and Bitcoin itself IS consensus, so really it needs to be stable in terms of development. However, the price we pay for this stability is that innovation can be slow. In an environment where failure really isn’t an option, things don’t happen very quickly. This leads to fears that Bitcoin will be displaced by a cryptocurrency with superior features or that banks will create private ‘blockchains’ that are just efficient enough that they condemn Bitcoin to remain in its current niche. I’ve felt it myself, and it’s kind of conflicting. That existential anxiety that because Bitcoin works so well at not being pushed to move in a certain direction, mass adoption will forever elude us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Side chains are exciting as they offer the prospect of a massive wave of innovation around Bitcoin. They also allow institutions who are understandably reluctant to embrace an anarchic cryptocurrency the ability to interact with Bitcoin in a more indirect way. They can create their own tokens, their own rules, and Bitcoin still benefits. This allows for a change of narrative, with institutions able to take the line of “Bitcoin is okay, but we’ve created this awesome side chain that makes it better…” . It aligns the interests of all blockchain development, with those of Bitcoin, as there are huge incentives to develop your block chain as a side chain to the Bitcoin network, with its vastly superior hashing power. I think that when we have working, useful side chains is the point at which it becomes clear to the general public that Bitcoin isn’t just strange internet money backed by some interesting technology that might be useful in banking one day but that Bitcoin is THE blockchain protocol, with all of these amazing features and businesses growing around it. Blockchain and Bitcoin will become synonymous in the public consciousness as these side chains come to fruition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I know this is highly speculative and I’ve said nothing that hasn’t already been said, I’m sure, but the possible implications of side chains as a step-change in the pace of Bitcoin adoption just really excites me. I’ve glimpsed the possibilities that this trend toward the further decentralisation of blockchain development has opened up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, if anybody could expand on the comment I made about side chains being secured by the hashing power of the Bitcoin blockchain that would be great. As I understand it, they have nodes themselves but no miners (as the tokens are not created, rather pegged to Bitcoin at a fixed rate)? I read the white paper a few months back and I’ve watched a few comprehensive Youtube explanations but I’m still not clear on this point.\n",

      "Help me with this please, I'm having a frustrating debate with a friend who claims that more total supply is worse than less total supply when it comes to a coin. I'll use Ripple as my example. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a fundamental flaw of Ripple that it has a total supply of 99 billion, versus Bitcoin's 21 million. My friend's position is that only a single factor (available supply) needs to be taken into account to calculate scarcity & demand, the only thing that matters is that total supply of 34 billion > 15 million, therefore Bitcoin is more scarce and in higher demand. \n",
      "\n",
      "My position is that it is not a flaw of Ripple (or other coins) to have a huge total supply, given that the three factors I consider key are balanced accordingly. It is my position that in order to calculate scarcity & demand, 3 factors need to be taken into account: total supply, available supply and reward rate. You cannot calculate scarcity & demand with only one factor alone.\n",

      "Now let's propose that Bitcoin and Ripple where actually exact clones of each other in terms of utility, code, popularity etc, and the only differences between them are the available supply, total supply and reward rate. And that it is accepted that the price of each coin is currently/will always be scaling relative to the total supply and available supply. In other words, yes, utility and stuff is a factor in this as well, so let's neutral out as many of these added factors as we can by considering them clones in that regard. And naturally 1 Bitcoin is going to be worth more than 1 Ripple if there are only 21 million possible Bitcoins available versus 99 billion possible Ripple available.\n",

      "* Coin B with a total cap of 10,000 coins and an available supply of 1,000 coins\n",
      "\n",
      "In his argument, coin A is more scarce than coin B because 100 < 1,000\n",
      "\n",
      "In my argument, you cannot calculate scarcity based off only those two numbers because you also need to factor in reward rate. Now let's suppose the reward rate is the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Coin A has a reward rate of 10 coins per day (reaching total supply exhausted in 10 days, 100/10)\n",
      "* Coin B has a reward rate of 100 coins per day (also reaching total supply exhausted in 10 days, 1,000/100)\n",
      "\n",
      "As such, both coins are equally scarce in my position, but in his position coin A is more scarce because 100 < 1,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's propose that coin B had a reward rate of 200 opposed to 100, and that the total supply would exhaust in 5 days instead of 10. As such, coin B would actually be considered more scarce in this circumstance (in my position), regardless of there being a greater \"total number\" of coins. So given these examples, what is the better investment? What yields the fastest returns, and the biggest returns?\n",

For Bitcoin enthusiasts Arnhem is like heaven as you can practically pay everything with bitcoins. You can do your groceries at the SPAR supermarket, you can fill up your car at a local gas station, you can have dinner & lunch at more than 20 restaurants, go to a barber, dentist, massage salon or one of the many shops and pay everything with Bitcoin. And for tourist, there are 5 different hotels and bed & breakfasts where you can stay for the night from budget to high-end.\n",

After some time, it was clear this protocol needed some adjusting to cope with the 'real' world. Now, rather than abandoning the protocol or making severe adjustments to it #cough hard-fork#, it was decided to improve the efficiency of the protocol using some ingenuity. Borrow some bits here, use them there, and suddenly we have drastically improved the protocol!

I understand that it is calibrated so that block validation is done on average every 10 minutes.

      "Bitcoin originally allowed anyone in the world to adopt the infrastructure and share a relatively even probability of solving a block with whatever hardware they had laying around. It very obviously provided the most decentralised means of securing the system, as there was the potential for billions of independent miners to get involved without a pay wall.\n",

      "Arguably, having billions of miners to do less, more decentralised work, has a far greater value for the network and bitcoin as a whole, but unfortunately, that's not what is going on, and there's not a whole lot of talk against what is.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we have instead, and scarily similar to the world government economy a lot of us are trying to escape from, is a small number of wealthy individuals who have complete power over the rest of the world, and whose fortune is increasing because of their existing stranglehold. In fact, the bitcoin system ENCOURAGES this by the means of the coinbase fee, which not only makes those individuals richer, but further forces out casual, everyday spenders, by increasing the adoption cost of mining to help secure their own assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "What makes it even worse, is that we've already witnessed the politics of our open-source currency and been put into a scenario of having to vote the future of it. As far as I'm aware, this isn't as simple as just running a wallet node to show your support for a specific change, as hashing power is being used to measure opinion, and is obviously more far more valuable as such. So for some crazy reason, we've got the big bitcoin mining operators (who are already holding back the mass adoption of small-scale, decentralised mining), investing to ensure they make the most money over their \"competitors\" (via their hashing power (money)), who have ultimate control and ability to change the entire system in whatever way they see fit, even if it doesn't conform to the original vision of bitcoin or the average user.\n",

To make a long story short we bought the rights to some music out of our own pockets but another company is claiming it is their (version)songs when it's not. Over a month later we have yet to communicate with a human being at youtube but in the mean time we have been blocked on all mobile devices on earth. And unfortunately since we're just a bunch of guys who only do this on the side as a hobby we can't afford a lawyer to fight this bullshit claim that's in another country. Given that I've seen a bunch of big youtubers come out and talk about this and my  own personal experience with this, it's making me really scared to try and start my own channel even though I should be steering really clear of copyright infringement.

Also, Circle Pay only always .68 Bitcoin to be bought per week but Coinbase allows $100 a day (from bank account to bitcoin.) I won't be purchasing $100 a day that often, but I don't like the limits on either one.

This will start with a 3 month period of time in a web development bootcamp, followed by my job search.  I have two credit cards, an old Chase card and a new one which has a 0% introductory APR for period of time.  I want to access the money via the 0% purchase APR on my new credit card, without paying the 4% fee charged for handing out cash... Anyway here are my two ideas.\n",

In order to pay off my credit cards every month (to avoid damaging my credit as well as avoiding any interest on my old C/C) I am thinking about paying off one credit card with the other every month.  Effectively switching where my balance is held every month.  The problem is both my credit cards (yes even the new one) have a balance transfer fee of 2% which would really add up after 6 months of balance transfers back and forth... That is unless I pay off my balances each month using bitcoin purchased @ 0% on my new credit card.\n",

After doing some digging it seems the at least one exchange (cex.io) charges a 3.5% fee on credit card purchased bitcoins - effectively killing my idea at least with that exchange...

I like the concept of Bitcoin (even though transactions do seem to take a while), but if you buy a gift card with Bitcoin so that you can use Bitcoin at real retailers and then use the gift card to pay, are you really still using Bitcoin for the transaction any more?  I mean, I don't run any kind of mining, so the only way I get Bitcoin is to purchase it with a card or my bank account.  If I purchase some Bitcoin with a card, then use that Bitcoin to buy another card, how is that any different or better than just buying the Gyft card with a credit card to begin with?

      "\n",
      "I think this is misleading in some way.. It sounds like bitcoin core has many ideas for how to scale bitcoin without raising the block size and lightning is one of them. No... the core developer team is all in for the lightning network. Of course they proposed segregated whithness and maybe some other fine tunes which would all be nice additions for a blocksize increase.. but they don't want that increase. 2mb in 2017.. that's really the lowest value they could negotiate with the chinese mining industry. \n",

Or to a lightning network address?\" \"Does the person i send money to has to be online now while i send it? \", \"I just want to send money :/\"... But on the enduser side the level of complexity added is nothing compared to the level of complexity added to all implementations that use bitcoin right now.

If the core team will persist on lightning as THE scaling solution people will eventually just wander off to e.g. ethereum. If they will not persist on lightning then they will have to increase the blocksize anyway, the only reason to not do it now is to try to push such a crucial change for the ecosystem through. In the end it will not work but only slow down the growth of adoption.\n",

To manage it, you need a circular flow of income, and with bitcoins, there is none.

The rest are miners moving bitcoins between different wallets and address, and gambling. On top of that, there is what’s called “the change factor” which means each transaction gets counted twice. Next, the faithful say, there are eight million wallets. What they don’t tell you is that almost all of them are either empty or near-empty. In truth, Coinometrics at Cambridge says that fewer than 250,000 wallets hold one bitcoin or more. That’s not 250,000 people, that’s wallets, and most people have multiple wallets.

      "We have been excited and anxiously waiting for this for almost two years, waiting for development to finish, and Ledger has finally brought it to us! Wallet integration into a secure trusted element built right into your phone, which makes your wallet app almost as secure as having a dedicated hardware wallet!\n",
      "\n",
      "Some background and explanation first:\n",
      "\n",
      "Many years ago ARM, the company that makes most of the CPUs running in Android smartphones, has implemented something called TrustZone, or TEE (trusted execution environment), which is a completely separate processor sitting next to the main CPU, which has its own memory, display, and input. It's basically a whole separate computer. The original intent was to have banks use it for increased security instead of relying on logins and passwords. But banks didn't care, so that chip has sat there, in everyone's phones, doing nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until Ledger came along! They wrote a small wallet interface that loads into that TEE chip, and does all the key storage and signing there. So far it works with Mycelium and Green Address (for Android).\n",
      "\n",
      "The way it works is, when you install and set it up, the applet is loaded into the secure chip, and the chip goes through the process of generating HD private keys. **These keys NEVER leave that chip.** Then Mycelium Wallet gets the public portion of that HD wallet that lets it manage your accounts (xpub). When you create a new transaction, Mycelium checks your balances, creates the transaction, opens a secure encrypted channel to the TEE chip, and sends that transaction to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the TEE receives a transaction request, it opens a new screen, on top of your Android OS screen, so it's impossible to fake, and asks, \"Hey, what is this, and what do you want to do with it?\" You have to physically tell the chip that you do want to approve of that transaction, at which point the transaction is signed directly on the TEE and sent back to Mycelium Wallet, which then broadcasts it to the network.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is basically the equivalent of having a hardware wallet connected to your phone's USB port at all times, but built right into your phone. And nothing, not rooting, hacking, or physically accessing your phone (short of guessing your pin) will allow an attacker access to your private keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's as I've been saying, in the future we will go from phones that run software apps, to secure cryptographic devices that also run a phone app, and **the future is now!**\n",
      "\n",
      "The link to download Ledger's applet us here: \n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately it only works on some phones right now (mainly newer Samsungs), but more and more phones will be added over time. I have been using this thing since September for hundreds of transactions, and never had a problem (I'm a terrible beta tester, not being able to find any bugs), and it's great being able to carry any amount of coins without worry!\n",
      "One of the common arguments against a HF to increase the block size is that there are benefits to establishing a transaction fee market. Wouldn't smaller blocks help to accelerate the growth of a fee market? \n",
      "\n",
      "For this reason, why aren't those opposed to a block size increase advocating for a block size decrease? \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a formulated argument:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Premise 1**\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people view higher transaction fees as a good thing, *ceteris paribus*.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Premise 2**\n",
      "\n",
      "Lower block sizes create demand for higher transaction fees, *ceteris paribus*.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, to increase transaction fees, it is reasonable that some people should agree that the block size should be lowered, *ceteris paribus*.\n",
      "I know the 10 minute goal for confirmations helps keep the bitcoin network secure. But with the current total hashing power of the bitcoin network, I don't understand why it can't be changed to a 5 minute goal. If you halved the confirmation time, and halved the reward schedule, it would still work out to mining the last bitcoin in the year 2140, just like it is in the current setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "In July of this year the reward is going to halve from 25 to 12.5 every 10 minutes (on average). When that happens, they can change it to every 5 minutes and 6.25 BTC. That's still the same 12.5 every 10 minutes. And the block size (for the time being) wouldn't have to change from 1 MB to 2MB, because there would be twice the blocks for 10 minutes worth of transactions. \n",

      "tl;dr: I have some coins I mined years ago, decided a few weeks ago to put them in Coinbase to cash some of the money out and use a few BTC to play with day trading on their exchange. After weeks of no issues, I have to verify my driver's license. I do, it's verified successfully, then trading is disabled on my account. Coinbase then takes 4 days to let me know that \"Unfortunately a manual review has determined that you are ineligible to use the Coinbase platform to purchase Bitcoin.\" I did my homework and there shouldn't be any issues here. My coins are from mining, I've never sent any to anywhere except Coinbase and I've only cashed them out from Coinbase. \n",

      "As good libertarians, most of us like the sound of a \"fee market\". It implies that fees are not set by a political committee, but decentrally determined by economic forces. In an ideal market, Adam Smith's famous invisible hand pushes prices towards marginal costs as supply and demand adjust accordingly, thereby setting incentives right for the optimal use of the available resources. No central planner could possibly do better.\n",

      "Unfortunately, the \"fee market\" frequently mentioned on /r/bitcoin is far from this ideal. Whereas demand can indeed adjust, supply is subject to an arbitrarily imposed limit. Such a limited \"fee market\" is closer to a planned economy than to a free market. In order to get closer to the libertarian ideal, supply must be allowed to adapt. As long as this is not the case, speaking about a **\"fee market\" is a misleading half-truth**.\n",

      "\n",
      ">* Bitcoin Core 0.12 introduced a new blocksonly setting. When set to blocksonly a node behaves normally but sends and receives no lose transactions; instead it handles only complete blocks. There are many applications for nodes where only confirmed transactions are interesting, and a node which still verifies and forwards blocks still contributes to network health-- less, perhaps, than one that relays transactions: but it also consumes fewer resources to begin with. An additional downside they don't get the latency advantages of signature caching since every transaction they see is totally new to them-- this isn't something miners should use.\n",
      "\n",
      ">* How much less bandwidth does blocksonly use in practice?  I recently measured this using two techniques: Once by instrumenting a node to measure bandwidth used for blocks vs all other traffic, and again by repeatedly running in both modes for a day and monitoring the hosts total network usage; both modes gave effectively the same result.\n",
      ">>* How much is the savings?  **Blocksonly reduced the node's bandwidth usage by 88%.**\n",
      "\n",
      ">* A significant implication of this is that **any scheme for bandwidth reduction which works by using already relayed transactions to reduce the size of transmitted blocks can *_AT MOST_* reduce the overall bandwidth usage by 12%-- assuming that differential compression achieved an \"infinity-fold\" improvement**.\n",
      "\n",
      ">* Why does relay use so much bandwidth?  The fundamental reason for this is because relay in the Bitcoin Protocol is linear in the number of transactions and the number of peers. (E.g. bandwidth is a function of Transactions * Peers).\n",
      "\n",
      ">One possible scheme I've been discussing (and working on) for a while is mempool reconciliation.\n",
      "\n",
      ">>* The idea is this, at random intervals a node will ask one of it's peers for a sketch of the top X MBytes of it's mempool. In it's request it could also signal that it's interested only in transactions whos ancestor feerate is over some minimum threshold, along with information about the size and feerate of its own mempool.  The returned sketch is an IBLT of some size estimated by the sender based on the information sent by the requester. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>* Unlike the efficient block transmission IBLT proposals, this IBLT only transmits transaction IDs-- which will avoid the fragmentation overhead needed in sending whole transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      ">>* The requester then attempts to reconstruct the IDs using the content of it's own mempool.  If it is unable to reconstruct all of the IDs, it requests from another random peer with a different seed.\n",
      "\n",
      ">>* When the node has multiple IBLTs it can use the partial solutions from each of them to help solve the other ones. \n",
      "\n",
      ">>* As it learns new txids that it was previously unaware of it then fetches them via getdata. When it completes a reconstruction it can INV any missing transactions towards the peers that didn't have them.\n",
      "\n",
      ">*In any case, this scheme would avoid the quadratic-like behavior of relay bandwidth.* It would let nodes trade latency off vs relay overhead, and it would allow for a graceful way of handling the highest priority transactions first. -- transactions a dozen or more blocks deep in the mempool are not going to get mined any time soon, so if they have lower relay latency from reconciling them less frequently that is no great harm. I believe it could do so without substantial increases in vulnerability to attack. The same software infrastructure could also be used for bandwidth minimized block transfer for nodes that do have mempools (otherwise blocksonly gives optimal bandwidth gains), though latency minimization is much better accomplished via techniques like Matt's efficient block relay protocol-- since the most important thing to minimize latency is to minimize roundtrips.\n",

      "A while ago I looked into the Blocksize debate and with the information then available and the arguments pushed by Classic, I felt like I saw the light. I joined /r/btc, installed bitcoin unlimited and later Bitcoin Classic and felt good about it.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "My reasoning was very simple:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) My transactions got stuck from time to time and I got annoyed waiting for confirmations. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) I believed that just increasing the blocksize would solve the issue, everyone can handle 2MB right? \n",
      "\n",
      "3) I didn't like the fact that a lot of Core devs were all working for the same company (Blockstream) and  at that point I believed the goal of Blockstream was to create a LN with paid subscription, which was mentioned a lot of times on /r/btc. Trying to force the average user off the blockchain. \n",
      "\n",
      "4) I didn't like the moderation on /r/bitcoin.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "**What I've come to realize in the last week:**  \n",
      "\n",
      "1) After reading the arguments by Peter Todd and other core devs in regards of the scaling it makes sense. You can't keep increasing the blocksize, it's the wrong approach. Bitcoin by itself will never be able to handle the amount of transactions Visa can. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) I like the fact that the Core team took the time to have a meeting with the big miners and some other big players in the market to come up with a consensus that neither side is happy with but both can live with. (that shows that it's a real consensus and not someone bullying the other one in a bad agreement) \n",
      "\n",
      "3) If you try to read /r/btc it's always the same, excuse my French, circlejerk. Always boiling down to the same issues they have with Core and Blockstream, instead of trying to focus on something positive. After reading [this post]( about one of the main guys behind Classic, I started to have a bad feeling about it. \n",
      "\n",
      "4) /r/btc tries to take pride in the fact that there is no real censorship, try to make 1 post where you something remotely positive about Core (not even related to the issues with Classic) and you'll get downvoted to oblivion, it's just another type of censorship. \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The fact that one of the Blockstream employees, Mark Friedenbach, didn't like the consensus and was open about it, showed to me at least that there is more going on than just Blockstream trying to push their agenda and that they do have, for now, Bitcoins best interest in mind. \n",
      "\n",
      "6) There is still room to grow if we can fill those empty blocks being mined and Antpool that only fills to 730kb, that should be more than enough until segwit comes out.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "**Other reasons why I switched back:**  \n",
      "\n",
      "1) Core has a lot more combined programming experience than Classic, I'd rather have a team that has the experience since they will see most potential issues from miles away. Note: Gavin is not an active programmer anymore and so he has nothing to do with Classic code. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Some wallets will immediately implement Segwit as soon as it's in production and anyone aware of this will use it to get in the next block. I see a lot of people immediately using this which will decrease the mempool. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) 1 year is long, I admit, but if you've ever been involved in a complicated software project you know that you need enough time to test and prepare all the clients, make everyone upgrade. There will always be nodes that \"forget\" or just don't upgrade. \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Just increasing the blocksize doesn't work, you need an alternative, LN is the only real realistic solution I see. I don't see 16 MB blocks happening. \n",
      "\n",
      "5) The Classic community is really small actually, but very vocal and negative. Just check the posts on their page, either extremely negative, trying to find some words they can twist from someone to make it seems they are evil, or the other posts are just that they mined a couple of blocks with a very limited amount of support. \n",
      "\n",
      "6) The Vocal leaders of Classic Olivier, Brian, Marshall, Roger, either don't have any coding experience, don't understand the impact or they are just not people I want to associate with.\n",

Unlike most currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by any governing body and instead it works on the principle of consensus. Every transaction made within the Bitcoin system is recorded and this record is shared with everyone in the system. If a person tampers with the record, his version will be different from the majority of people in the system and so it will not be accepted. At this point, you might wonder what would happen if a person managed to convince the majority of users to accept an incorrect record. This would be a valid concern if the system consisted of just 10 or 20 people but Bitcoin now has over 4 million users – and is still rapidly growing!

      "\n",
      "I think the best would be to look into historic transaction data and make some statistics on fee/byte vs how much delayed the transaction gets mined.  The transactions doesn't contain any timestamp, but i.e. blockchain.info seems to store the received-timestamp for every transaction.  I would like to play a bit with this, but I'd like to ask for comments first.  (there are so many different metrics, important to decide \"what should I do with this data\" before collecting data, it's always possible to find data that supports a hypothesis if first deciding which hypothesis is right, and then searching for the right data).\n",

      "The indirect approach would be to use historic estimation data from cointape.  I've thrown up a crontab that fetches the data from cointape every hour, since 2015-11-06.  The fees and mempool was growing until mid-December, then there was more than a month of downtime, and when cointape came up again the fee estimates was pretty much lower.

      "\n",
      "- There was no transaction backlog on the bitcoin blockchain until two days ago. At 2pm CET February 28th the transaction rate started spiking sharply, and the mempool started building up.\n",
      "\n",
      "- This was immediately followed by a relentless campaign on social media, claiming bitcoin is non functional, broken, doomed.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The transaction fee on the vast majority of these transactions is extremely low, 1-10 satoshis per byte to be exact. If we say 5 satoshi is the average, and knowing the median transaction size is 258 bytes that means 1290 satoshis / 0.5 cents per transaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "- At the moment, with all these transactions sitting in the mempool, you can still be guaranteed to get your transaction confirmed in the next block by paying 60 satoshi per byte, or 15480 satoshi / 6 cents for a median sized transaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we can all agree that getting a transaction confirmed on the blockchain has some value. The hashrate is astronomical, the integrity of the transactional data we get to write on the ledger is beyond anything we have had access to earlier. The moment the mempool is starting to fill up with transactions with fees of 50 cents, hundred times the 0.5 cents of today, I would say we have a legitimate and somewhat urgent problem with the blocksize. I believe we will see scaling solutions implemented long before then. But in the current climate of sudden spikes in transaction numbers with very low fees, I suggest regular users make things really easy for themselves and start paying something like 10 cents per transaction. \n",

      "3. Remove decimals from the currency.  Instead of the smallest unit being 10^-8, make it much larger.  This will allow users to store the entire UTXO pool with a fixed (but smaller) maximum size.  For example, if the smallest unit was 0.1 BTC, then each wallet would be required to store at most 210,000,000 addresses with a corresponding balance.  The downside is of course increasing the smallest unit with the benefit of less possible UTXO spam.  If this smallest unit was large enough, then in theory couldn't the block limit be removed completely?  Perhaps coins must wait a certain number of blocks before they are able to be spent again to prevent coin \"thrashing\".\n",

If everyone on the network believes that you have 1 BTC but your version of the ledger says you have 2 BTC, then it doesn't matter if you are correct or not - the community will not honor it.  The idea is similar to the community blacklisting your coins.  Money only has value if others accept it.  So keeping that in mind, is it really necessary to store the entire transaction history of the network?  After 10,000 blocks, why not just create a checkpoint block and drop the old history.\n",

Bitcoin is very important to lots of people all over the world.  How about we show some patience, confidence, and support for the developers for a change rather than negativity and fear?  That would be nice. \n",
      "Bitcoin is supposed to be a peer-to-peer cash system.  But we gave it nearly 6 years and found there was no incentive for regular people to use it.  We kept looking for Bitcoin's killer app, and scratching our heads as to why no mass-adoption was occurring. Let's not forget that. \n",

      "It turned out Fidelity and NASDAQ wanted in.  Patrick Byrne of Overstock wanted to build his new stock market system using it.  This is when we realized that Bitcoin's first real-life application may in fact be for businesses.  As a block chain system for very robust companies hoping to save billions, eliminate fraud, and streamline processes.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Only one problem:  Bitcoin's feature-set (and yes, speed) were too limited.  But it wasn't just block size.   Companies like Fidelity are very feature-rich. They would need a highly flexible block chain system with many forms of extensibility in order to duplicate their many processes onto a block chain. Bitcoin simply couldn't do any of that.  It's just peer to peer cash. \n",

      "So NASDAQ bailed from Bitcoin and made their own. Patrick Byrne (Bitcoin's biggest proponent) bailed from the direct use of the block chain and went with another system.  Fidelity threw up their hands.  And many other companies did too.  And everyone here mocked them and called them idiots for not using Bitcoin.  \n",

      "So what if Bitcoin scales to 2MB?  Or even 8MB?  What then?  Do we really believe this is suddenly going to open the flood gates for usage?  Let's not forget where we were before this debate.  Sitting around scratching our heads while our family and friends thought we were weird. We were still hoping that the consumer public would find some mass-incentive when there really wasn't one.  \n",

      "**Raising the block size limit is necessary, now**, but this doesn't solve the problem of making Bitcoin feature-rich enough to become a relevant / major player in the block chain revolution. Especially with major corporations which could've skyrocketed demand and shot Bitcoin's value straight to Pluto. \n",
      "\n",
      "I keep coming back to this analogy, and I don't know if it's a valid one: if only there was some way to make the bitcoin block chain similar to the iPhone app software. It's just a cell phone. But on the layer above, literally millions of unique, highly customized applications can be built which latch into it. But this requires that the foundational layer has the capability to support such latches.  \n",

      "1. Ledger Starter: Very quick. Bare bones. Secure initialization of the ledger device. After trying all the products, I feel this is necessary for the super tinfoil hat people, as restoring devices in the other apps requires typing the phrase into the chrome app. Plus it was pretty cheap. Met all my expectations. 8/10\n",
      "2. Ledger Unplugged: Used it with Mycelium on Nexus 5, and boy it was cool. The only part I thought was a little awkward was the security card. I remember some smart cards with little screens to check send addresses, and Unplugged made me want those more. The process was a bit too awkward for what I have come to expect from smartphone apps in general. 6/10\n",
      "3. Ledger HW.1: I got the Copay edition. It's cool that the logo is on there haha. The only real problems I had with this one was figuring out I had to leave the adhesive on the backside and fold it over on to the adhesive... I am a habitual adhesive scraper, so I got half way through scraping it when I realized there was no mechanism to snap it shut except the adhesive. I was confused, lol. Also, I felt like I was going to break it all the time when inserting or removing it. Not sure how long it will last, but it seems to work just as fine as Nano, but for a fraction of the price. Thanks to the price point, I'll give it a 9/10. Went slightly above my expectations. (Except for the build quality of the plastic, that was slightly below)\n",
      "4. Nano: This feels like the winner. Initialization with the Starter is much more simple (if you squint your eyes at explaining how to boot a USB) than, for instance, Trezor. (Trezor is a 10/10 in my book, don't get me wrong. I own one.) However, normal initialization on the Chrome App is rather insecure. You need to be confident in your computer, which I tend not to be (to be on the safe side) I give the Nano 10/10 with the Starter, 8/10 without the Starter.\n",

I thought Starter + Nano was amazingly easy, and would love to recommend... but the English BIP39 phrases always give people pause... breadwallet and Copay have not had that problem when I recommend them, as they both support BIP39 Japanese wordlist.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been using Trezor and love it, but I can't really justify recommending it to people here, the price point and difficulty of initialization along with lack of Japanese support including phrases always made me hold back, but Starter + Nano might be my new go to recommend for more serious investors and if it ever became Starter + Nano + full Japanese from start to finish, I'd definitely recommend.\n",

      "Bitcoin is revolutionary to the extent that it provides an apolitical means of storing and exchanging value. Money is more political now than ever, and when someone tells you what you can and can’t do with your money, they own you.

I’ve seen the estimates, some of them written by Hearn a long time ago indicating how the BBC can scale to PayPal loads or Visa loads. So what?

The BBC is the all-important settlement layer. \n",

      "Ask yourself – why don’t we already have this exponential explosion of micro transactions? It’s not because we don’t have the technology. For instance, Google aggregates page views and clicks and mediates the exchange of value. Facebook monetizes people’s inner lives. This is extremely complicated and cumbersome. You probably think that Facebook and Google use these techniques because people like “free” stuff, like student loans! That is true, but there is another reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interactions with the users of Google and Facebook are not taxable, even though they are micro transactions of a sort. The aggregation of value and the payment of taxes are subsumed into the vast operations of Google and Facebook. Of course there is financial accounting, and money flows between Google and Facebook and the client corporations which use their services to gain access to the public, but the micro transactions remain unmolested.\n",

I think arguing for an increase when the lightning network actually exists and segwit is live will probably be a non-starter since hopefully in the future there will be absolutely no need for an increase.\n",

      "In 2015, bitcoin has got the attention of huge financial giants like American Express and Visa which has really improved its reputation in the market. The main reason behind the acceptance of bitcoin by financial industry is the blockchain system which facilitates low-cost trading. Resultant is the huge investments and interest of big shots like Schroders and Aberdeen Asset Management in bitcoin. On the whole, there is a ray of hope for this digital currency to enter into the mainstream business soon. However, there are still many who are ignorant about Bitcoin invention or find it hard to accept it as a new currency. Under such circumstances, what would make the leading e-commerce business owners to accept bitcoins?\n",
      " With the increasing interest of corporate world into the Bitcoin, there are speculations that US government might accept it as the currency. And if that happens, e-commerce entrepreneurs would be in loss if they don’t recognize bitcoin. Last year, many bitcoin related start-ups have popped up which further pushes e-commerce businesses to relate with the world of bitcoin. But how people who run e-commerce portals are going to benefit is the question that lurks in many minds?\n",
      "To start with the list of benefits that e-commerce business owners can expect from virtual money, foremost thing to consider is bitcoin would attract an entirely new and huge customer base. There are many consumers who are eager to use their bitcoins and e-commerce portals have the maximum potential to quench their desire. Secondly, bitcoin is a strong factor that can make any e-commerce portal to stand apart, leaving behind the competition. \n",
      "Thirdly, e-commerce portals can get a big relief from the extra costs associated with credit card transactions. As bitcoins have relatively low transaction fees, e-commerce business owners have the chance of saving more. Not to forget the important and last advantage of bitcoin over conventional currencies is it can be transferred to anywhere in the world within ten minutes. The promptness of bitcoin holds a great value in this digital era where everything we need with the speed of light. \n",
      "With some basic and essential security certifications like SSL encryption, e-commerce businesses can certainly amplify their growth with many folds. However, it would take time for this native currency to completely overtake the prevalent national currencies.

Recently I've decided to actually open a wallet because I found some good use for Bitcoins (I play poker online, cash out with BTC looks promising). I also started to read this sub more often but I see that there is some tension in the community. Something is going on and I am not sure what it is and how it's affecting the community and Bitcoin in general. Something about delays? Issue with core team developers? Would anyone explain and get me on board about all these challenges? \n",

You are all trying to centrally plan bitcoin by adjusting the block-size to meet a goal that cannot be derived. \n",

There is no direct evidence that this attack was orchestrated to pump and dump litecoin, however, it did show a possible vulnerability to attack Bitcoin's user base. This attack is a direct reward response for spamming the blockchain as it can frustrate Bitcoin users to make them move to altcoins. The rising of the value of the altcoins gives fuel to spammers to sustain the attack. If I was coordinating the attack I would do it something like this:\n",

The attack is much cheaper sustain also now that blocks are closer to being full. I am not saying this the case with the certain altcoin that has seen very large gains recently, but it could be a possibility. I do fear these types of attacks will get easier as blocks get more full. If I was the attacker I would try to cause a fee event in Bitcoin where tx fees were pushed to bubble like levels. This could possibly be done nudging the lower limit of transaction fee's that are guaranteed to be in a block higher and higher until it snowballs and causes a panic. If this occurred frustration levels would skyrocket, users would be envious of the altcoin's rise, and a large portion of Bitcoin's user base would be captured and dumped on.

They get transactions stuck because they dont know they have to pay attention to transaction fees. 21 Inc. did the right thing by making a site which helps determine what fee is appropriate. But the problem is some wallets use a different metric. In due time a standard for how to measure and determine fees will emerge and it seems like the x amount per kb per satoshi is winning out.

      "I don't anticipate that fees will be needed anytime soon, but if it becomes too burdensome to run a node, it is possible to run a node that only processes transactions that include a transaction fee. The owner of the node would decide the minimum fee they'll accept. Right now, such a node would get nothing, because nobody includes a fee, but if enough nodes did that, then users would get faster acceptance if they include a fee, or slower if they don't. The fee the market would settle on should be minimal. If a node requires a higher fee, that node would be passing up all transactions with lower fees. It could do more volume and probably make more money by processing as many paying transactions as it can. The transition is not controlled by some human in charge of the system though, just individuals reacting on their own to market forces.\n",

Everyone is saying \"We have to raise the blocksize yesterday!\" As if there are hords of people trying to use bitcoin but can't due to the limit. I'm here to tell you it's all garbage. We could eliminate the block limit tomorrow and make blocks limitless or leave the 1MB limit for all eternity and it would not impact the success of Bitcoin. Markets are like a flowing river. No mater what you put in its way it keeps flowing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's explore a world where the block size is never enlarged from its current state of 1MB. Like any market when the supply is limited and the demand is growing, the price goes up. Like a river flowing in a small canyon between 2 mountians, the depth of the water goes up to handle the amount of water. With only 7 transactions a second the price of each transaction will rise. Making sure the most important transactions go through. This will change bitcoin slightly for the short term. The Bitcoin network will be used for large money transfers and micro-payments will go away (temporarily) because they are too expensive. With enough people using bitcoin it may even become too expensive to buy a meal at your local restaurant that excepts bitcoin. I know what you're thinking. \"Micro-payments are a huge advantage bitcoin has\" and \"If retailer's stop taking it we won't be able to spend it and it will kill the bitcoin economy.\" You're not completely wrong if you thought of those but those things will put pressure on developers to develop side-chains and off-chain transaction solutions. Bitcoin will be used to buy cars and houses instead of coffee. It will be used to transfer large sums of money instead of tipping your favorite podcasters. If a restaurant or a podcast host wanted to keep taking bitcoin, in the short term they could have multiple POS (point of sale) systems so if their customers use Coinbase then they can take off-chain Coinbase transactions for free instead of a on-chain transaction with a large fee. If the block limit is never raised bitcoin will take a similar path as credit cards did. It may only be used in an emergency (like I need to transfer money in the next hour or my car gets repossessed), or if you're traveling outside your native country or you need to buy a car. Smaller credit card transactions at gas stations and McDonald's are relatively new. McDonald's only started taking credit cards in 2002. Many of us forget that our parents had credit cards for emergencies only, much like the early cell phones.\n",

      "Now what if tomorrow morning you woke up and the Bitcoin protocol was back to how Satoshi Nakimoto wrote it to be, with no block limit at all. What would happen... Mining would centralize (in the short term). But is centralizing pressure really bad? We think of bitcoin as decentralized therefore it is good and any pressures leading towards centralization would have to be bad. But that's a false dichotomy. There's a huge difference between a system that was set up to be centralized and one that was set up to be decentralized with centralizing pressure. When it comes to the former only the central authority has power. And everyone must appeal to that central authority to become active in the game. With the latter there is no central authority to appeal to. Anyone at anytime can join the network. It may become more expensive over time but anyone with the means can join without permission from anyone else. As more and more people would use bitcoin the percentage of would be miners to users will shrink, but the overal amount of miners wood grow. If there are a million Bitcoin users and only 1% are miners then there would be 10 thousand miners. Now if the user base exploded to 100 million and less than 0.1% of those people were miners we would have 100,000 miners. No one in their right mind would call a 100,000 miners a centralized network. Without any limits on the block size supply of transactions is unlimited and would be very cheap or even free. Bitcoin would be like a wide shallow river running through a large piece of flat land. Micro-payments would be possible and there would be no need for side-chains or off-chain transactions. Miners would determine the block size individually and mining companies would succeed or fail based on what limit they use. If the market pushes limits down then side-chains and off-chain transaction will be incentivesed again. With smaller fees and no limit we could handle a lot more transactions and with larger adoption we would be using the Bitcoin network for everything from a cup of coffee to a $0.05 tip to your favorite podcaster.\n",

      "\n",
      "So, in a scenario where I am the merchant doing business in-person, I wouldn't accept RBF transactions, right? I should think they're too high risk, especially if a customer can alter their payment immediately after they walk out the door, and if I don't get the CPFP window, I lose the transaction, right? Paredo-not-optimal. This must mean that future wallets will require an on-off RBF switch built into every single wallet, or else we are basically using two different kinds of currency and cannot interact, all because one person could not produce a safe 0-conf transaction. Not everyone even wants to hear about bitcoin, let alone how to act in a contentious RBF situation.\n",

      "The results of the fee event (last Monday when some users had stuck transactions, blocks were full, fees went up temporarily, and Bitcoin got a ton of bad press) has somewhat changed my view on the blocksize issue in the short term and I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

I have passionately argued with Core developers on here and bitcointalk about all the dangers of not adapting fast enough, pricing out use cases (and users) while Bitcoin is still in infancy and adoption is relatively low, and scaring off people who will only continue investing if they believe Bitcoin will be actively developed. I've spent maybe thousands of hours of my life reading and discussing this issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand very well all the dangers of full blocks. I know that when blocks are full its cheaper to attack the network (which is, effectively because you are only buying the marginal remaining capacity). I know that the Bitcoin user experience absolutely sucks and is made much worse by poor software that can't cope in these situations. I knew that Bitcoin was going to get a bunch of bad press and attention might shift to alternatives.\n",
      "And yet, the actual event itself has opened my eyes to a few things that I want to mention here. Things that I think are actually important and possibly are being ignored by a lot of us who support larger blocksizes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Many wallets completely failed to correctly calculate the appropriate fee and the users of those wallets got screwed. The ones that didn't have this problem worked just fine. That to me speaks to the immaturity of those wallets and the need for the market to force them to either be upgraded or replaced. The fact that Bitcoin has been around for 7 years and wallets still have a hard time calculating the appropriate fee is ridiculous. Perhaps the fee event was a good thing in that it showed users (who were aware of what was happening) that they should switch wallets and put necessary pressure on software developers to improve.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Along those lines, it appears that some companies are making horrible use of the blockchain. I did 7 withdrawals from Coinbase all within a short time period and that resulted in 14 blockchain transactions (because I understand coinbase does 2 transactions for each withdrawal) when it could have only been 1 total if the transactions were grouped. Now Coinbase did pay a fee for all of those, and its their decision to do so, but I'm having a hard time with agreeing with Brian Armstrong's posts when his company is significantly contributing to the issue. He should come to the space with \"here's what we have done to help scaling and its still not enough\", rather than purposely exacerbating the issue. In fact, why doesn't Coinbase have engineers submitting tested performance improvements to Core? What has Coinbase contributed to the core software at all. This is a meritocracy. Make things better and then people will listen to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Things did settle down and go back to normal a few days after the event. Appropriately priced transactions worked fine. Anyone using adequate software was not affected outside of a slight fee increase. This was certainly not the doom and gloom that a lot of us thought it might be. In fact, it was a decent test of what happens in the worst case when many users are using shit software and nobody is being efficient\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Price has maintained largely despite all this shit. It's even up 10% since Hearn's rant. That's a really good sign that at least the market isn't that worried.\n",
      "\n",

      "Hey guys, I'm doing a project for a college course and as part of the project we're suppose to discuss the merits of Bitcoin. While introducing the topic of Bitcoin and the Blockchain I was trying to explain it in terms that a person who has no knowledge of the subject matter would understand. \n",
      "Below is what I came up with.\n",
      "\n",
      "In relation to the blockchain – This is the underpinning technology which bitcoin and other similar applications use to function. On a basic level it works as a system designed to remove the need to trust the other party in a transaction via a method called triple entry. The need for trust is removed as every node on the network has a ledger which tracks each transaction, if a transaction does not match the other node’s ledgers it is stopped from being processed. The nodes are made up of each computer on the network i.e the computers belonging to people using the blockchain.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't feel this really works as a lay person explanation, any tips or suggestions as to how to improve this would be appreciated. \n",
      "The concept of blockchain technology and its various apps is currently overhyped while bitcoin’s role of money is underestimated. If we focus on developing blockchain security and the money application for bitcoin then all other apps will come easily afterwards. Instead many developers are distracted with second stage apps like smart contracts and verifiable data which have limited practical value until a secure and decentralized blockchain with a high valued tokens is established. In addition, banks and tech giants are competing to create private blockchains and VCs impatiently finance lots of promising projects blockchain projects without any sign that they will really work.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems like we are designing the fruit of a tree which still has a tiny stem. We should rather focus on growing a robust trunk with deep roots and only then discuss the beautiful apps that can be built on top of it. It may sound boring but we need more people devoted to the plain old problem of bitcoin used as money. Blockchain apps are important game changers but they will remain a mirage unless we have the foundation of blockchain based widespread digital currency. Going back to basics is especially important in the context of the block size problem which currently slows bitcoin’s adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s take a closer look at what makes a blockchain work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The blockchain could be used mainly for two things — transferring value and timestamping information. For these to work properly we need the highest level of trust and security possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Security is the main requirement for any blockchain which claims to be useful. It comes from fierce competition for the role of a temporary third party for a valuable prize. Actually when people say that there is no third party in blockchain transactions they are wrong. The third party is the miner publishing the block with our transaction. The revolutionary thing is that this third party is paid well for the service and is constantly changing because of the mining competition which is open to everyone. Therefore blockchain security equals fierce competition and fierce competition equals freedom for everyone to compete for a high valued prize.\n",
      "\n",
      "blockchain value = security\n",
      "\n",
      "security = competition = freedom to compete * prize for the winner\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, private blockchains which are not open for everyone to compete are inferior to those who are open. At the same time, the high value of the prize is also crucial for the competition. If the prize has zero value in an open competition there will be no participants and no security. In the bitcoin model the prize is currently 25 bitcoins + transaction fees for every block. So valuable bitcoins bring more security and additional security feeds more value in an ever growing spiral. Widespread adoption also yields more transaction fees which add up to the prize.\n",
      "\n",
      "So…\n",
      "\n",
      "Prize for the winner = block reward + transaction fees = bitcoin price + number of paid transactions per block = demand - supply of bitcoins + widespread usage = widespread usage - supply + widespread usage = 2x widespread usage - supply (fixed schedule we cannot change)\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore…\n",
      "\n",
      "Prize for the winner = 2x widespread usage\n",
      "\n",
      "=> blockchain value = security = freedom to compete + 2x widespread usage\n",
      "\n",
      "where 2x widespread usage = world’s most frequently used blockchain app = money\n",
      "\n",
      "=> the ultimate blockchain winner = freedom to compete + money\n",
      "\n",
      "So the prerequisite for all the promising blockchain apps is the first and main app - money. Consequently, bitcoin must become the most secure and user friendly money in the world. Then, progressively more people will be willing to give away government currency for these digital tokens and use them as a payment now or store their value for future payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, money is the most crucial app for the blockchain technology. In fact, it is so important that it dwarfs all the others. Most efforts of the blockchain community should go towards helping the bitcoin system achieve maximum durability, highly fungible units and user friendly experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "**EDIT:** \n",
      "The point of this article is not to open the blocksize debate. It is to show that private blockchains are not very useful. Also the thousands of blockchain apps people get excited about are much less important relative to the plain old money function. However, it will be hard if not impossible to create widespread usage while limiting the number of transactions.\n",

I find other big competitors with the same goal and they join me. First, I set up my own infrastructure (miners, full nodes, wallets) which implement a protocol change. The trick is avoiding hundreds of million dollars for mining equipment by changing the hashing algo in a way that allows me to mine a block every 10 minutes easily. It would cost me orders of magnitudes less than hundreds of million dollars. Then I fire up my miners, leading to a hardfork of the blockchain and I can mine easily block after block with the changed protocol. The key here is the wallet, not the miners. I offer my services through the new wallet only. My competitors do the same. Users are pretty much cut off from exchanges and payment providers unless they upgrade their wallets to the new protocol. Users can still transfer bitcoins p2p on the official blockchain, but that pretty much it was (it must feel like in the early days of bitcoin). The other miners can't attack my blockchain, since their sha2-miners are useless for that. It will take them too long to set up significant hashing power with the new protocol. \n",

      "\n",
      "We launched “Lawnmower: convert your spare change into bitcoin” a little less than a year ago & now we’re finally getting ready to move beyond what we view as just the first iteration of our product. We loved the attention garnered and ease of explanation from using the familiar “spare change” concept & applying it to a new investment that we obviously love – bitcoin. But as we once dreamed, we’d eventually move beyond both “spare change” & just bitcoin, and into a broader & more full-service platform.\n",
      "In this update, we’ve removed “spare change” and replaced much of the branding and screens centered around this concept, and in place have some brand new functionality, screens, and hopefully a much smoother user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the new update, you can now set up a totally customizable Recurring Purchase (similar to how your “spare change” automatically made you passive trades over time), as well as Buy & Sell bitcoin directly from the Lawnmower app with your linked bank account. The dashboard is now completely re-vamped, and we have a bunch of statistics on a fresh new “Analytics” page with a bunch of cool data on your account & trading performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a brand new logo, an optimized and smoother sign-up flow for new users, and an easy transition for existing users where we’ve provided an estimate of your previous weekly “spare change” volume that you can use to set up a similar recurring purchase. Another huge reason for the move away from “spare change” is to broaden out our infrastructure to set up for a large international expansion we’ve been talking about for some time, which we’re currently testing now. As you can also see from our “portfolios” tab, we’re also currently focused on expanding out our asset offerings beyond just bitcoin and providing you an easy way to invest in much broader portfolios of crypto assets – more info TBA :)\n",
      "\n",
      "More information on our update & reasoning can be seen on our recent [blog post]( and some explanation on the figures on our new “Analytics” & main dashboard can be seen on our [accompanying blog post]( where you can also quickly see some screenshots from the new app.\n",

      "Back in January I started looking into some strange voting patterns affecting several users who noticed their comments were routinely downvoted within a minute of posting. Some of these users had already reported the issue to reddit admins to no avail, so I wrote [a little script]( to continuously refresh the latest comments and measure how long it takes for each comment's vote score to change from the default '1 point'. Some users reported being affected when posting in /r/btc, so I included that sub as well. I finally started logging on January 30th. With the recent downvote attack against /r/Bitcoin, I figure now is as good a time as any to share this information.\n",

It didn't take long to see that virtually all the comments by several dozen regular contributors appeared to be getting downvoted to '0 points' within about about a minute, regardless of what they said or how old the thread was. And since I wasn't only measuring downvotes, I also found that a number of accounts had their comments change to '2 points' within the same time frame. \n",

      "\n",
      "The most alarming thing about this data to me is that specific users are being targeted, apparently based solely on their political views. I have not monitored how this might effect comment sorting, but it's certainly plausible that a comment with '2 points' will have an advantage over a comment with '0 points', potentially distorting reader perception.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to stress that a user having their comments instantly changed to '2 points' is not conclusive evidence of any wrongdoing on the part of that user.

It's not uncommon to open a thread and see a comment posted within the last few minutes, then cast a vote. However, given the amount of data accrued and patterns observed, it's seems pretty clear that false positives don't weigh heavily on the results.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Vote fuzzing\n",
      "\n",
      "Vote fuzzing is one of reddit's anti-vote cheating mechanisms which causes vote scores to fluctuate randomly within a narrow range in an attempt to obscure the actual vote score. This can be observed by refreshing a comment with around 5 votes or more, and watching the score randomly change plus or minus a few points.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, to the best of my knowledge, comments with a default vote score of '1 point' do not get fuzzed until after it receives a few votes. Sometimes you might see vote fuzzing on controversial comments, as indicated by the little red dagger^† (if enabled in prefs). You can verify that default vote scores aren't fuzzed by commenting in your own private sub (or a very quiet old thread in the boonies somewhere) and see that the vote score does not change when you refresh. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have no reason to believe that vote fuzzing applies to the data I've collected because I'm only logging the first change to the vote score. That said, it does not rule out the possibility these anomalies could be explained by some proprietary anti-vote cheating measure which reddit does not wish to disclose.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Admin response\n",
      "\n",
      "Reddit admins are generally pretty responsive when it comes to isolated cases, but this issue took a few weeks to address, presumeably due to the bulk of users affected and investigation required. They have confirmed that they've dealt with multiple accounts targeting these users with downvotes, but have also caution against drawing firm conclusions from this method due to various anti-vote cheating measures in use. Reddit admins have neither confirmed nor denied whether automated voting is taking place. It appears to still be happening, but the frequency has abated somewhat.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Other subreddits\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked at a few other subreddits of comparible size and found that votes occuring within 1 minute are rare by comparison. In fact, I extended the scope from 3 minutes to 15 minutes, and still did not find any anomalous voting patterns. Fast votes do happen, but I have yet to find any sub where they happen as fast as on /r/Bitcoin, nor have I found a sub where it appears specific individuals are targeted. I also looked at some much larger subs whose scores are not hidden (GetMotivated+mildlyinteresting+DIY+television+food) and found that while votes do roll in a bit faster, they still do not occur within seconds of commenting, and still do not appear to target specific individuals. There's room for more research in that area. \n",

      "My wife was just diagnosed with CVID a couple of weeks ago, it's like AIDS except it's not Aquired, it's part genetic and part environmental - but it's a rare primary immunodeficiency disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "She's had this her entire life. She's 33 years old, a wonderful mother to our 5 year old daughter, and beautiful singer, actor and writer. She was misdiagnosed 3 or 4 times, most recently she was eating gluten free for the last 8 years because she was diagnosed as celiac disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "She's lost most of her hair over the last 6 months and has been in the hospital 3-4 times this year. It turns out, she never had celiac, she has always had CVID.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Where Deep Learning fits in.**\n",
      "My wife should have been diagnosed in her childhood years, in fact, all it would have taken was a simple blood test to measure her antibody levels, and an Immunologist appointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all of her symptoms, her medications and blood test results - a deep learning algorithm would have been able to suggest a proper diagnosis in a few minutes instead of the 30 years that it took for her to get properly diagnosed by just letting doctors do their thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**The problem with diagnosing rare diseases:** \n",
      "CVID affects 1 in 25,000 - 50,000 people, it's a rare disease where patients present with a myriad of symptoms and autoimmune problems. It's hard to get a correct diagnosis because a patient typically sees many different doctors to treat the different types of symptoms, and they don’t typically share information efficiently - nor do they have an incentive to properly diagnose her.\n",
      "\n",
      "There should be a visually appealing, easily marketable app that combines machine learning and crowdsourced input from app users to give the \"hot/cold\" direction that will greatly improve time to diagnose these \"zebra\" cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The average lag time for CVID diagnosis is 6-7 years. This is common with most rare diseases. If my wife was diagnosed even 2 years ago, she would not have lost all of her hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "The treatment for my wife’s condition is IVIG every 2-4 weeks, and it greatly improves quality of life and life expectancy. The earlier a rare disease is diagnosed, the better the quality of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The problem with doctor-facing AI solutions:**\n",
      "I see that there are some machine learning startups, but they are mostly targeted towards health professionals. There’s resistance from doctors to adopt AI. \n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is that this technology needs to be available for the patient, not just doctors, and not just specialists at John Hopkins or the Mayo Clinic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody is going to be as motivated and investing in someone's health as the person and their loved ones. Quite often, patients with diseases become more knowledgeable than the specialists treating them for the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "There’s a lot of knowledge to be tapped into there from the 'zebras' themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Potential barriers to a centralized organization providing this solution:**\n",
      "The FDA and drug companies are resistant to technologies that allow users to diagnose themselves. 23andme ran into issues with this. They just finally got FDA approval in October to start helping people agian (\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Some existing projects:**\n",
      "A friend who sold his company to Salesforce for 70 million dollars introduced me to this TED talk shortly after my wife was diagnosed, where Jeremy Howard explains how deep learning works, and it’s potential applications:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "^Jeremy's company Enlitic is using deep learning to help doctors come to a proper diagnosis faster, currently only focusing on radiology. Again, it's just doctor-facing.\n",
      "\n",
      "www.findzebra.com is a search engine that you can input your symptoms, it uses something similar to deep learning to suggest possible health issues, but it doesn’t use AI. It crawls and indexes only curated medical sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeremy Gardner & the Augur guys introduced me to www.crowdmed.com which is a great solution for diagnosing rare diseases, but costly.\n",
      "\n",
      "CrowdMed is a site where you tell your story, and then it uses crowdsourced knowledge to come to diagnosis suggestions. You pay a monthly fee of $299 - $749 a month, and then “medical detectives” investigate for you, and their predictive market algorithm ranks what the detectives submit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vitalik Buterin of Ethereum told me about www.numer.ai which is a competition that uses homomorphically encrypted machine learning to let people try to predict the stock market. It’s a way to anonymize data, to alleviate some concerns about people’s medical data being publicly available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Xprize even has a $5 million dollar prize up with IBM Watson for AI \n",
      "\n",
      "There's also openai.com, with names like Elon Musk & Sam Altman attached, it's a non-for-profit with a billion dollars committed, but they haven't yet released what their focus is.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Potential solution to being blocked by FDA etc:**\n",
      "Decentralized deep learning on a blockchain, where users are rewarded tokens for providing the hot/cold and running the network. Think ethereum, bitcoin, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my limited understanding of machine learning, it seems that for a deep learning algorithm to learn, humans need to give it hot/cold inputs to the correlations it comes up with as it compares datasets (Jeremy’s ted talk video explains that)\n",
      "\n",
      "My theory is that a decentralized deep learning algorithm on a blockchain could be built where the people giving hot/cold inputs are awarded with a token for doing the mechanical turk style work. When consensus is achieved, the people who were correct get rewarded. Similar to how Augur’s reporting system works, or bitcoin’s proof of work.\n",
      "\n",
      "If users are rewarded for giving correct hot/cold inputs to help the deep learning AI learn about subjects, there’s a financial incentive to keep the network running.\n",
      "\n",
      "Companies, individuals, universities, etc could tap into the algorithm to use it for whatever purpose they want - and they would pay to use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "IE I want to build an application that uses deep learning to help diagnose rare diseases so people like my wife don’t have to suffer going undiagnosed and untreated their entire lives. I would pay to have the algorithm learn about the human body, how it works, diseases, treatments, etc. The users of the network get paid to \"train it” with hot/cold inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there anyone working on anything like this, whether it’s centralized or decentralized?\n",

      "Since a person simply has to have an internet connection to instal a wallet and receive payments, billions of people in poor countries will have access to financial services all of a sudden. This will unlock the knwoledge of these people into the global economy.\n",
      "Think this way: Lack of Education/skills are by far not the only reason why some countries are less rich than others. For example bad institutions, lack of infrastructure, opressive regimes, lack of legal protection, corruption etc. Therefore if these people would come to countries with better possibilities to be productive, these people would earn much higher salaries. With Bitcoin these skilled people can sell their productivity (or export) to richer countries.\n",

      "\n",
      "What I think many people do not realize is that Classic activates as soon at 75% of blocks flag support for Classic in any 1,000 block period.  That means at the time of the activation there will always be around 25% opposition from miners and that **Classic can never activate with more than 75% support from miners.**  Statistically Classic is more likely to activate with less than 75% support, as if support slowly approaches the 75% level, then Classic miners are likely to eventually get lucky and activation will occur before 75% support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Has anyone looked into the maths of a 75% activation threshold?  I tried to run the numbers in the chart below.  I assume Classic has activated and that a Classic miner first publishes a 1.1MB block, which gives Classic a one block lead.  I assume Classic has 70% hashing power, which is likely as Classic is more likely to activate when support is below the 75% level. (Is this 70% estimate reasonable?)\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's what happened: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Tried to book a hotel on Expedia with bitcoin. Coinbase handles Expedia's bitcoin payments, so when you checkout using this method the Coinbase website comes up showing the bitcoin payment address and amount\n",
      "\n",
      "2. I sent the exact amount of BTC requested, immediately \n",
      "\n",
      "3. But then... the Coinbase payment screen never acknowledged the transaction and the timer counted all the way down to zero. I was redirected back to Expedia's check-out screen to pay again, as if no funds had been sent at all!\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "At this point I was taking screenshots and checking that my payment was showing on the blockchain. Yes, there was 1 confirm within minutes of sending the payment. Am I victim of the mempool backlog that was happening at the time?\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "So I emailed Expedia my screenshots and explain what happened. Nothing but obnoxious robo-form replies. The suggestion? You must call in if you want to cancel and refund your booking. But I have no booking! \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "I call in, spend an hour on the phone, and because they can't see bitcoin attached to any booking, they have no idea what to do and no way to refund anything. Expedia's resolution? Email Coinbase. At this point I was offered a $100 voucher for a future booking. Nice but nowhere near what I'm missing right now.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "I email Coinbase. They respond acknowledging they can see the transaction and even offer technical details, and suggest I email them to Expedia, because only Expedia can process refunds. Now I'm doing the back-and-forth work between Expedia and Coinbase. Great.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "So I email Expedia again - nothing but form responses despite providing everything they would ever need to resolve the issue. The suggestion? Call the call center again. What a huge time waster!\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Back and forth more times. No resolution. Expedia support can't get over the idea that if there is no booking, then I could not have been charged out of my \"bitcoin account\".  I'm sorry, but I can see my payment right here on the blockchain! And need to talk to someone who understands bitcoin, but Expedia doesn't have anyone like that at their call center. Conversation goes downhill when they ask me to contact Coinbase for a resolution yet again. \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, a ticket is opened with Expedia's \"bitcoin department\" and I'm told to expect a response in 24-48 hours. It's now coming up on two weeks and no response at all. WTF.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, I go back to Coinbase for more advice, which is to email another support address at Expedia. So yet again I message another department at Expedia with the details of what happened. No response ten days later.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "So my fellow bitcoin aficionados, here's the problem. You have no recourse when you try to use bitcoin as a payment method in a world where a big merchant like Expedia can jack you around like this. A credit card at least has a chargeback process for when a merchant can't get their act together. \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",

      "I withdrew BTC to the wrong address. I did what I thought was best and contacted cloudbet support as fast as I could. They told me that my issue would be sorted out shortly. This is when the user \"Cloudbet Support\" was replying to me. Since they told me it would get taken care of, I did not think to take any other measures to ensure that my BTC would be sent to the correct address. I should not have trusted the support and taken extra measures to ensure it would get taken care of. The support told me that all transactions that were of high amounts (in my case it was 3.0 BTC) are manually reviewed by the team before being sent out. About 18 hours later I check and they sent out the bitcoins. So not only did the support lie to me, I just lost 3 BTC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now here is the catch. Another support person contacted me trying to explain that I sent the coins to the wrong address. I got that. I don't need to be told what I already know. The support person then started to lie to me. You can see what they said in the last screenshot. This person refused to refund because of their support lying.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I look forward to seeing your reply on this now public issue. I really don't want to handle this privately anymore. I am not going to take the chance of being lied to even more.\n",

      "------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Proof of them saying it would get sorted out shortly\n",
      "\n",
      "Proof of them saying that each transaction is reviewed\n",
      "\n",
      "Now here is the best part. This is the support telling me the above two things were never said (different person)\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Proof is in order: \n",
      "I bought 3 of the Cryptosteel wallets through the original crowdfund. I understand [shipping can be a problem]( but losing all 80+ parcels is a little far fetched; especially while I see them being sold on BuyTrezor site. So, how is it possible I have not received my original crowdfunded Cryptosteel wallet, but they are being offered/sold through the partnership with Satoshi Labs?\n",
      "If in the US, I would be very skeptical of purchasing a Cryptosteel wallet until the original US crowdfunders' orders have been met.\n",
      "The chinese have devalued the renminbi by the most since jan 7th.  Why has bitcoin not moved up in price?\n",
      "The benefits are so significant that centralized exchanges wouldn't be able to compete. A P2P platform could very well become one of the market leaders. Why aren't we seeing them?\n",
      "Just noticed that all the private keys that I generate are starting with L or with K, is it still safe to use?\n",
      "I am generating addresses for a cold storage(got in the site, turned off my internet and then generated them and put them on a usb, plugged the usb out and then connected the internet again.)\n",

      "I'm probably not the first person to notice this, so this may be a reminder for some of you, but I have a machine that runs a public bitcoin node and its received a scan for wallets. There would need to be some serious misconfiguration for this scan to succeed. This emphasises that its not a good idea to store a wallet on a machine that runs a public bitcoin node. These are failed http requests that occurred in a 24 hour period. (They have bee repeated on subsequent occasions).\n",

The “interviews” will consist of an anonymous short (10 min) survey, or email chat (whatever you prefer) and I’ll ask you a few questions about how perceptions and interpretations of price fluctuations with Bitcoin.

      "On Monday, I purchased some BTC and decided to go with Coinbase because they stated the bitcoin would arrive on or before March 25th. The guarantee that I would receive my bitcoin before the weekend holiday was a crucial factor in my decision to purchase from Coinbase rather than Gemini, which does not have such an accurate estimation (at least to my knowledge). However, when I logged in today I found that the system actually stated that it would be arriving in two more additional days. I received no email notification from Coinbase. Furthermore, according to my bank balance the amount was already deducted.\n",

If you don’t see your order complete by then feel free to reach out as soon as possible so that we can get this resolved for you.\"\n",

      "**UPDATE 3 (March 28): ORDER ARRIVED. While I have to say that support didn't go above and beyond to help me or provide any sort of incentive for continuing to use their service despite the issue, they did at least complete the order and Rosey provided a much appreciated explanation. Rosey from Coinbase: \"I'm very sorry that your BTC were not delivered on the day they were estimated to arrive. This tends to happen when orders are being created prior to the bank cut off time and actually placed after the bank cut off time.

      "Contemporary advertising tries to create false needs, false desires based on extrinsic reward systems and immediate gratification.   Why support that model at all? It does little to identify and attune with each unique person's intrinsic motivations to engage.  If the aim of marketing design was flipped to elevate and support people and appeal to their intrinsic motivations for engagement, then truly people would pay for such a service.  Why make people pay bitcoin not to see ads?  Instead, why not provide the methodology for deep engagement through relevant products and services in attunement with each person's aspiring skills, talents and interests?  This means you cannot only use past behaviors or purchasing patterns as the defining data (as objective and measurable as it is) to extrapolate future behaviors.  To know what motivates someone from the inside-out, to support and grow radical personal  responsibility necessary for decentralized self-organization, BRAVE and bitcoin will have to be committed to novel design that moves large human populations off standardized platforms driven by carrot-stick extrinsic reward systems and the dependency upon extrinsic  validation systems (systems of control and conformity) and  begin to design for radical personal responsibility.  There is new cutting edge science emerging in this and it has everything to do with self-organization of chaotic systems and ensuing emergent patterns of engagement.  Design synergistically  with Nature's patterns, dont bully and dominate her!  Decentralization means we cut the ties of dependency upon centralized authority structures and design for self-determination and synergistic personalized engagement experiences. Browser experience should be determined by each unique individual from the inside-out, not  mandated by outside vested interests, paid or unpaid.  Be BRAVE!  \n",

Is there anyplace online that's trustworthy where you could sell a number of coins at that price?

So yes, everything seems great as they have more assets in their reserves than they do to the obligations to customers. But is it really fully reserved?

      "So the basis for the discussion is that we got there - the market cap is much larger than today. How we got there could be from private demand initially, followed by government and/or central banks taking an interest, big investment banks... whatever. The key point I'm making is that regardless of how we got to that point, once the market cap reaches a certain level, governments and central banks will take a significant interest in bitcoin.\n",

      "\n",
      "So let's say the UK governmant is concerned that citizens are increasingly choosing to exchange sterling (Great Britain Pounds, i.e. GBP) for bitcoin, e.g. as a store of wealth in an unstable financial environment. The effect is large enough that sterling starts to fall relative to bitcoin. Let's say this same scenario is playing out in other major economies, the US, Canada, Europe as a whole, Australia & NZ, maybe India, South American countries, perhaps even China and Russia.\n",

      "\n",
      "(2) Governments see bitcoin as a threat to their ability to govern, and/or their power. No consensus can be arrived at between governments, possibly because in the background some of them have already conceded that bitcoin is competing strongly with their fiat currency, and are exploring ways of obtaining some controlling power over bitcoin, e.g. through building mining farms and buying bitcoin.\n",
      "\n",
      "This could lead to an arms race dynamic between governments competing to take control of miner share and to increase bitcoin reserves. \n",
      "\n",
      "Is this a sane scenario? A government would be losing it's ability to control money supply, and although taking mining share doesn't necessarily improve that, it does mean that the money supply isn't being controlled by foreign governments. So they each maintain a share of the mining capacity to maintain a vote (or perhaps it's really a veto on change) over bitcoin monetary policy. \n",
      "\n",
      "At this point I wonder if a fork would be coordinated such that western democracies would split away from China, Russia, etc. Perhaps it would be deeply incompatible to have governments and economies with big political differences operating on the same blockchain, and a fork is seen as a reasonably workable middle way. A fork might also be seen as a way de-escalate the arms race and reduce spiralling energy demand from mining.\n",

      "\n",
      ">Once one commodity starts to be favored, the optimal strategy is to move to that currency. So we have shown that sufficiently high mental transaction costs are sufficient to cause the emergence of a currency standard, even in the absence of storage and transport costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "He gives greater detail and relevant explanation but here is the key point:\n",
      "\n",
      ">...with sufficiently low mental transaction costs and sufficiently unpredictable exchange rates, it pays to hang on to multiple currencies, and a world of multiple currencies is the equilibrium\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly:\n",
      "\n",
      ">At the extreme of zero mental transaction costs, zero storage costs, and zero transport costs, we have a pure barter market, with no need for money at all.\n",

      "\n",
      ">After good proxy measures have been developed, one must obtain or estimate user preferences in terms of these measures. Obtaining preferences directly from the user has to be done in with traditional value granularites, otherwise mental transaction costs dominate. Alternatively, further proxy measures can be made that estimate user economic preferences from their normal input behavior. These are then compiled into automated nanotransactions with the market translator. \n",

      "\"I apologize i have not shown up for the community until now. I designed the platform in 2007 that Sotoshi built for me in 2008 and now for you. This platform needs to get through consensus for a final decision on applying a scalible code. I prefer a 4mb to 8mb scale. It can scale only so high. Also mr. Ito is right and wrong. Sotoshi and i picked Gaven to run the platform and to follow our well thought out theory of rules. Those rules must be followed today! Without our Vision, bitcoin means nothing. Therefore rules are rules followed by a select group of core developers. Developers watch each other by distrust to complete the task. I am hearing that core is working for big $$ complanies to push their agenda. That would be a conflict of interest. Must stay true to the platform first and formost. If those companies are pushing too hard for scalability too fast. Drop them as they are not supposed to have ANY control period. REMEMBER! BITCOIN IS STILL JUST A EXPERIMENT! Sotoshi and I and core have backdoor keys if Bitcoin needs to be--shut off, completely. We will see our vision through as we theorized it to work towards great innovation. Core developers have to agree with each other to implement code. The other communities work to build the code, and vote for a final decision on changes to be made to the platform. 75% vote. I picked 75% for the rules and that is the way it is This platform has to stay peer to peer sharing, or our vision is lost and so is Bitcoin. Let me make this clear- Bitcoin is run alongside the Dollar. It is not to take over the dollar. If the dollar fails, bitcoin is to prop up a economy until agreements are made to print more tangible dollars. Sotoshi and i agreed that tangible U.S. Dollars must be kept in circulation. Do not out the dollar for a cashless society or Bitcoin is dead too and will turn corrupt too just like fiat. The whole community and developers must follow Sotoshi protocols. If you want to make changes like Mr. Hearn, leave Bitcoin and build your own platform, separate from bitcoin. Thanks, Bitcoin Founder2433\"\n",

If you do listen long enough you find out that Craig, earnest creator of Bitcoin, and true heir to a MILLION BTC apparently has some procedural issues with a trust securing his funds, which could all be resolved with a bit of money-- but unfortunately, the evil dictators controlling his country have frozen all of his money... and that's where you come in dear reader.

I just wanted to buy .11 BTC but I'd prefer not to have to wait a week. Thanks for any help\n",
      "First of all, I should note it's **not a big deal** and there are no reasons to panic or anything, but it's just remarkable that the thing we knew is theoretically possible is happening now.\n",
      "\n",
      "To provide background on this kind of attack I need to start from fundamentals. Here's the security assumption from the Bitcoin paper:\n",
      "\n",
      "> The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally mining was done by users themselves, it was a part of node/wallet software. However, later it became more specialized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hashing, running nodes and using Bitcoin are completely separate things nowadays when pooled mining is commonplace. That is, somebody can \"mine\" bitcoins using his hashing hardware without running a node. (And, perhaps, without even being a Bitcoin user, as a \"miner\" can auto-convert his revenue to dollars.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Calling this \"mining\" isn't quite accurate. More precisely it can be described as **renting** (that is, mining pools rent hashing hardware of so-called \"miners\") or **paying for a service** (mining pools pays a \"miner\" for the efforts he's performed).\n",
      "\n",
      "Some \"miners\" believe that they receive bitcoins they created, but it's not true in a general case. One thing is that more often then not, individual miners fail to solve the block, but are still compensated for their efforts (not for results). Also pools generally have reserves which they use to smooth out reward payments, thus rewards miners receive do not necessarily come from freshly mined bitcoins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's recall that hashpower is intimately linked to the security of the network. Attacker who controls a significant portion of total hashpower might be able to perform double-spend attacks (e.g. see Meni Rosenfeld's [Analysis of Hashrate-Based Double Spending]( or denial-of-service attacks (he might mine empty blocks).\n",
      "\n",
      "It is usually understood that these attacks are practically unfeasible, as overpowering the honest network would require enormous amounts of hardware, energy, etc. However, there are several different attack model.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most primitive one was relevant back when mining was done on CPUs: an attacker could rent CPU power from a cloud provider such as Amazon and try to do a double-spend reorganization or a 51% attack. It's fairly easy to do calculations within this model as the cost of an attack is known (for a certain difficulty) and one just needs to compare it to potential profits attacker might get.\n",
      "\n",
      "But CPU mining is irrelevant now, attacker would need specialized hardware to have a chance. This makes attack much more complex, as attacker needs to buy hardware, deploy it, start mining... And once attack is complete, he needs to do something with that hardware. It's generally understood that parties who own hashing hardware will be reluctant to perform attack because a successful attack can drastically decrease the value of the hardware they own. Thus it can be said that ASICs made Bitcoin much more secure due to this stickiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait... what if an attacker **rents** hardware instead of buying it? It's much simpler than buying hardware: no complex logistics, little overhead, no concerns about how an attack would affect hardware price. Attacker would need to pay slightly above the market price to make sure he gets more than a half of total hashpower to make sure that it's statistically certain his attack can succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This can be describe as a sort of a bribe. Normally miners get block rewards (subsidy + fees). Attacker adds a bribe to it, making it `subsidy + fees + bribe`. This is attractive to miners as it pays more. Once attack is successful, attacker receives `subsidy + fees + attack profit`. Thus his cost is \n",
      "\n",
      "    (subsidy + fees + attack profit) - (subsidy + fees + bribe) = \n",
      "          attack profit - bribe\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that `bribe` can be arbitrarily small, it should be just enough to get miners interested. It can be 1% of a subsidy, for example. E.g. suppose attacker wants to earn 1000 BTC by double-spending, he gives a 10 BTC bribe to miners to orphan some of the recent blocks and pockets 990 BTC.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cost of this attack can be arbitrarily small, but it requires a lot of a capital and is also quite risky. And also it's not possible right now because miners do not just rent their hashpower to the highest bidder, they use mining pools they trust. Thus there's no way for the attacker go get more than 50% of total hashpower to be successful with this attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are, however, pools which allow people to rent hashpower. For example, [NiceHash]( It currently has 16 PH/s of SHA256 hashpower (according to the stats they publish), thus controlling around 1% of total hashpower. NiceHash allocates hashpower to highest bidder, and thus it can be potentially used for attacks I described above. But currently it's too small to have any effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this is just something to keep in mind. Pools like NiceHash are evil, they can potentially destabilize Bitcoin if more than a half of total Bitcoin's hashpower will be rented out on pools like this. It is important for miners to choose legitimate pools.\n",
      "\n",
      "So until now I thought that a bribe attack is just a curiosity in context of Bitcoin (it might be more relevant for alt-coins with much weaker hashpower), but today I was surprised with the fact that somebody tries to pull it off right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a post on /r/btc: [Someone just donated 16 BTC towards Classic Hashpower. We are now at 2 Petahash/sec on Slush pool. Thank you, donator. The fund is at 30 BTC and recycling the mining rewards over and over.](\n",
      "\n",
      "This is exactly the bribe attack, but they aren't using for double-spending or DoS, but on an attempt to hard-fork Bitcoin. Basically it's an attempt to artificially prop up Classic hashpower a little, and is good only for PR. But still it's something we should be aware of, I think.\n",

      "First of all there is a small chance of catastrophic fork during 2016 spawned by the blocksize debate. Core devs have not scheduled a blocksize limit increase for 2016, and it could cause unrest among users, and a split in the community. Im sure Core s version will continue to be used, but the exchange rate on bitcoin will take a hit. Even if this doesent happen, the markets will still be anxious about the halvening, and the future of bitcoin, given the blocksize limit debate and general scaling concerns. I think the market will wait it out. We will remain in the $400-$500 range with possible brief dips below, until end of the year, when there will be a big rally.\n",
      "So I have been a coinbase customer for years. I have bought many thousands and sold many thousands of dollars worth of btc. They suddenly decided that I dont live where I do anymore and they wont accept any variation of my address. They have locked me out twice for trying to give them my real address too many times. They do not respond to tickets unless they are being publicly trashed because all they care about is their public image not the service they provide. I am at the point where Im gonna have to move to circle I guess. Coinbase doesnt seem to want to let me conduct business with them anymore.

      "Imagine publishing a photo to Instagram or Snapchat or Vine and allowing users to tip tiny tiny amounts of bitcoin to each other. Each social media post gets a wallet address attached. Integrate a tipping mechanism into your application. Imagine users being able to tip down to the satoshi range of bitcoin. The money goes into a wallet controlled by the app creator. From there, the wallets are programmed to do a 90/10 split of the profits with the creator. The wallet is public so the creator can actually see the transactions, and by being open with every transaction the app creator has their commission server outsourced to the blockchain. I feel like this is one step closer to enabling people to exchange bitcoin with a purpose. If I followed someone on Instagram and it allowed me to tip something silly like $0.0004 worth of money, Id do it. Celebrities could forward the tipping to charities. Social media could be used for entrepreneurs could crowdfund themselves for an idea instead of kickstarter. Models could run their own webcam shows and accept tips on their own terms. Politicians could raise funds through social media by using qr codes on campaign signs. Im excited to start seeing these things coming out.\n",

      "So I made a transaction of a couple hundred bucks on bread wallet to my trezor but its status keeps saying \"unverified\" sometimes it will tell me that I need to rescan the block chain so I do that. But It cancels the transaction and then immediately tries do the transaction again. Thus repeating the process of having unspendable BTC in transaction limbo. I tried to send another smaller transaction of about 10 bucks to \"prime the pump\" so to speak. But now I just have two unverified transactions no matter how much I rescan the block chain. What the hell is going on here? all my settings are just the default and I made transactions from my bread wallet to this address before with no issue but then all of a sudden its stopped working. Is my BTC lost forever? Edit: Looking at all my wallets received and sent transaction it appears that when I first started having issues I may have accidentally double spent coins some how. However I definitely should still have some BTC left in my Bread Wallet but its still unspendable. This sucks cause its about 300 bucks man!\n",
      "Stop. Before you downvote, let me explain. No, I have not been hired by Blockstream (I turned down their offer ;) The reason I support Maxwell’s Scaling Roadmap is because it adds finality to this debate: There will be no increase to the max block size limit by Core in 2016. If you share my view, then this is unreasonable. The block size limit needs to rise, and it needs to rise soon. Since Core has made it clear that they will not do this, the only option is to deprecate Core in favour of competing implementations. As part of my New Year’s resolution, I will stop trying to convince Core developers to change their minds. They have made their decision and I will respect that. Instead, I will work with other like-minded individuals to return Bitcoin back to Satoshi’s original vision for a system that could scale up to a worldwide payment network and a decentralized monetary system. I will also welcome existing developers from Core to join me in these efforts. The guiding principle for this new implementation is that the evolution of the network is decided by the code people freely choose to run. Consensus is therefore an emergent property, objectively represented by the longest proof-of-work chain. The final sentence of the Bitcoin white paper states: “They [nodes/miners] vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.” It is this mechanism of \"voting with their CPU power\" that keeps Bitcoin permissionless and uncensorable. Were it possible to compel miners to run a specific application with a specific set of rules then it would be trivial for the owner of the codebase to, for example, invalidate transactions, modify the inflation schedule, block certain bitcoin addresses or IP ranges, limit the quantity of transactions in a block, or implement any other centralized policies. In other words, Bitcoin only maintains its intrinsically valuable properties of being permissionless, uncensorable, trustless, and uninflatable, precisely because the software is not, and should not be, controlled by any single governance entity. So please join me in an effort to move away from the single governance entity that presently controls and handicaps Bitcoin: Core. Let me conclude by saying that what is unfolding is the best possible scenario: we will get a significant block size limit increase in 2016 and we will decentralize development. Happy New Years everyone! \n",
      "Antpool is bitmains pool and F2Pool is discuss fish. Both chinese companies. One a hardware manufacturer and one a hardware consumer. For the last few months despite the hash rate changing wildly both have managed to stay in near perfect lockstep of each having 25% and both adding up to 50%. Never getting off by more than 3%. It seems very likely to me that at this point they are simply one pool or are working as one pool and now control 50% of the network and have found a 25% split between two apparent pools the most appealing option. What other explanation is there? The rapid change in hashrate should have disturbed their perfect 25/25 distribution at least a little bit but they hold it nearly perfectly. With no jockeying that would indicate they are reacting to each other and no gain or loss relative to the other pools. \n",

However, my withdrawal history still shows nothing.. so just something to keep in mind!\n",
      "These are some issues and practicalities around bitcoin that confuse me, so Im hoping that more experienced Bitcoin users can shed some light on them. Firstly, For the real Bitcoin believers, do you spend the bitcoins you already have regularly? The reason I ask is because it seems to me that the believers must expect the price to rise substantially over the coming years, so wouldnt it be wiser to hang on to every single bitcoin they have? For example, if I owned some shares and was expecting them to rise in price, I likely wouldnt sell them right now. Secondly, when a person decides to get bitcoin for the first time they usually would need to buy it with fiat currency. But that means that a current holder has to sell to them. If supply and demand balances out, doesnt that mean that there are lots of sellers that arent expecting the price to rise much in the near future. I realize that people will also be selling for other reasons, but there must be some that prefer fiat currency, else they wouldnt sell. Thirdly, if all goes well with bitcoin and the price continues to rise steadily, thats causing deflation. So wont that mean people holding off on making large purchases because they know they can get the same product for less next year. e.g. if you want t buy something that costs 2 BTC now, and you expect BTC to double in value against USD, then you are better waiting until that happens and buy for 1 BTC. \n",
      "I noticed this in the FAQ section: >[Why is Bitcoin the only supported payment method?]( >Bitcoin is used because of its unique benefits over other payment methods. Just like OpenBazaar, there are no fees (or very small ones) to use Bitcoin, and theres no permission required to send or receive Bitcoin either. Bitcoin also allows for an escrow system that is very secure. Bitcoin gives people more control over their own money, and this fits in perfectly with OpenBazaar, a tool designed to give people back control over their own online trade. \n",

THE ENTIRE REASON for apis from bci and cypher is to do it without this low level customization etc.. but NOPE not good enuf..

LOOK you think im a jerk for this rant but the honest fact is i only need two thinks take payments make payments without MODIFYING MY LINUX OS which by the way is standard centos with cpanel whm. Why must I run a service to use their apis? Tell me folks why is this so difficult? PHP SCRIPT STEP BY STEP TO TAKE FN PAYMENTS AND GET NOTIFIED AND TO MAKE PAYMENTS..

      "This is a work in progress, so any constructive criticism is appreciated. --- In the beginning there were few people running btc, records indicate that Satoshi, or SN, mined more than half of the blocks in the first year. Over times hobbyists began to run nodes, often for a small amount of time before stopping. Some very few amount of people believed in the idea and ran their computers as often as they could. But times have changed and people cant use a desktop to mine bitcoins anymore. Specific hardware components called ASICs have been developed. Application specific integrated circuit chips are not like computer chips in normal computers, they are built and specialized for specific uses. Bitcoin mining companies have created their own ASICs which perform the lions share of mining these day, they also get most of the reward. Some companies produce these chips and sell them to other companies and the public, while some companies fabricate these chips and use them themselves.  There are a number of players that each have some amount of influence on the bitcoin ecosystem. Miners Mining pool operators Nodes Users Companies Developers Governments ISPs  Influence of Miners Miners secure txs and holdings. Many miners all operating independently create security for the Bitcoin system. If most miners stop working then someone with enough hashing/computing power could give their coins back to themselves after they gave them to someone else. This is known as a 51% attack as this bad actor needs over 50% of the networks hashing power to succeed every time. With more miners this becomes very expensive. It is thought that by spending as little as 2 Billion USD someone could buy enough hashing power to perform a 51% attack as of 2015. Miners can refuse to put into blocks any txs they dont like, blacklisting someones chance to get their tx into the next block with whatever proportion of global hashpower that miner has. However this is usually very small, so little chance, and even so then next block is likely to contain said tx. If miners colluded they could try and censor a tx for a little while, but with many miners this would only be a delay and a difficult on at that. Miners control putting txs into blocks and creating blocks for the blockchain, they receive a generation transaction known as the coinbase reward for doing so. If they stopped working they would stop getting paid. Can they control a system if they cant destroy it?  Io Mining Pools Mining pool operators run the software and full blockchain that others use to collectively mine. The bigger and faster a pool, the more blocks it will find, the more reward it will get, the more its members will get paid, the more people will want to join it. Its the miners computers that do the calculations but it is the pool operators that harness that hashpower and apply it, giving out more consistent rewards for everyone. But people are just doing the computations that the pool tells them, if the pool operators wants to they could try to censor txs from or to someone they disagree with, making it harder for that person to send to receive payment. But like miners their attack would only be a delay. Unless they conspired with other pool operators to in which case they would increase their chances of success. They would need over 50% of the global hashing power to succeed with this. If they shut down miners could easily move to another pool  Io Nodes Nodes can and often are run by altruists who want to help the network at some minor expense to themselves, if it is only time. Business, and those with a large stake in Bitcoin also run nodes but they do it for their own sake and not to help the network. Nodes receive broadcast txs, validate them, and rebroadcast them to their list of connected nodes. The network could likely sustain a large drop in nodes, but this increases the risk that any one node or group of nodes could refuse to forward txs they disagree with.  Io Users Users are people who spend and receive coins on some time table. Some might consider those that buy and hold coins not to be users, but that is talk for another time. If the users are unhappy with the system they might leave and use another system. If Bitcoin or any crypto has no users it has no utility, because what use is a system no one wants to use. Users have to bear the consequences of developers decisions. They have to wait for inclusion in block, wait for conformation, pay fees, use wallets or client software, etc. If most users stop buying, selling, and txing the media will surely report on Bitcoins impending doom, which may scare others away exacerbating the problem. Though in many stories in the past have cried wolf in this regard cryptos still exist, if there was an insurmountable problem in one crypto users would probably migrate to another option.  Io Cos Companies control things such as exchange points like websites and kiosks, wallet application and hardware, mining hardware production, websites or discussion forums, remittence or transmission applications, etc. They can publicly endorse any changes they agree with disagree with and try to sway opinion. Those with a large number of users can try and use said numbers of users as leverage for support of proposals. Each realm has a number of things it can do to influence workings or public perception. Some companies have in the past performed capacity tests on the Bitcoin network, throttling normal transactions and clogging the network. Companies and individuals with enough knowledge and malice can temporarily slow the network, but to do so require spending resources on fees.  Io Govs Governments have exerted little influence so far on cryptos, with some agencies advocating against heavy regulation that might stifle new growth. A few governments have issued restrictions or outright bans on cryptos. Restrictions mostly apply to businesses and those that deal with local fiat. These actions might stifle start up companies that dont have large amounts of funding. Banning use of cryptos, particular ones or in general, makes it illegal for people to use. This can make cryptos less popular locally or push their use into the black market. Government exert local power and some government like to censor the internet. Crypto use is still possible but it is more difficult.  IoISPs Internet service providers, or ISPs, connect most homes and businesses to the internet. All internet traffic goes through them before being routed to the end recipient. Much web traffic these days is encrypted, but much of that encryption is weak or compromised, and a large amount of web traffic isnt encrypted at all. So anyone who taps into the connection can see what is happening. This is especially easy for ISPs who host the traffic. ISPs then have the ability to monitor some amount of web traffic, and stop thing that they dont like from getting out or to the real recipient. They also have the ability to modify data in transit and or reroute it. This means they potentially can reroute the hashpower of a mining pool to their own ends. However these actions would likely be detected quickly and corrected; and nothing like this has ever been documented. --- This is all part of an intro so Im not going into great detail here, and some things arent perfectly accurate for the sake of beginners.

      "Hi Redditors, With our (rather widely overlooked) launch on June 1st of last year for our HD Multi-sig wallet that uses Libbitcoin for block querying and is written in elixir and erlang we would like to remind the community that we are still here and still working towards a better bitcoin experience. In the VERY near future we will be open-sourcing our Block Explorer dubbed \"Voyager\" to developers looking for lightning fast block queries and serious scalability. Our current wallet has a few great features including: - HSMs in a level 3 datacenter - Txs signed on Ledger HW.1 Hardware Secure Modules - Fully scalable infrastructure Obelisk / Libbitcoin: - Scalable and secure data transit - Real time blockchain queries Other security features: - TOTP (time based one time passwords) - BIP39 BIP44 compliant - Memorable image on login (anti-phishing) And finally our Key security features roadmap: - Client side HSM signing integrations - Native apps (mobile, desktop) - Browser plugins - Offline transaction signing w/ Ledger and Trezor - Offline Seed / Wallet generation Our p2p marketplace which is coming this year will have PGP encrypted chat, multi-sig escrow wallets for every trade and an easy to use interface as well as a turing complete price-scripting page using Lua. Im just writing to remind everyone that though we are a small company we have remained true to Bitcoins core values such as privacy, decentralization, and financial autonomy. We believe that keys should be held by owners and not wallet providers. If you are considering a Multi-sig wallet I highly recommend you give us a try. Our code is written in html5 and works on all android devices for mobile use. Mnemonics are client side encrypted on individual devices. We are aware that on apple iOS it is not possible to access the camera but for Android it works great. Cancoin is a super fast, private, free and easy to use wallet that gives users all the control. What more could you want? Check out our blog for more information: and sign-up for a free wallet: Help us stay in the race and stay tuned for more updates. Thanks. \n",
      "We hear the trope \"LN transactions are Bitcoin transactions\" all the time. Lets examine that. I think most of us would say that if Alice and Bob each have an account on Coinbase worth 1 btc then we might say that both Alice and Bob own Bitcoins. After all they each can check their Coinbase balance and it says 1 btc. But Alice and Bob are choosing to leave their Bitcoin on an exchange. What we know after MtGox is that COINBASE owns the 2 Bitcoins associated with Alice and Bobs accounts. Alice and Bob each own an IOU for one Bitcoin payable on demand by Coinbase. If Coinbase blows up tomorrow there is nothing on the blockchain that proves that Alice or Bob owned any Bitcoin at all. In fact if Coinbase blows up, Coinbase still controls the 2 Bitcoins belonging to Alice and Bob. And if Alice sends her Bitcoin to Bob on Coinbase? Coinbase generates a ledger entry for this transaction but it is Coinbase, not Bob, who controls the Bitcoin. So we say that \"Bitcoin that are not in a wallet whose keys you control, are not your Bitcoin.\" What we will see is that when one uses Lightning, the Bitcoin associated with that transaction are \"not in a wallet with keys you control\" and therefore \"not your Bitcoin\" - in fact they arent Bitcoin at all, but IOUs of other Bitcoin just like the Coinbase transaction. A transaction that happens like the one on Coinbase is called an off-chain transaction. The key thing to note is that off-chain transactions do not reassign Bitcoins to a new owner. They are simply IOUs that indicate that this transfer needs to happen sometime in the future. Thats why off chain transactions are best thought of as IOUs or promissory notes. So along comes Lightning. Lightning promises, using some interesting cryptography, to offer instant p2p transactions. That part is great. But are these Bitcoin transactions? Well theyre clearly denominated in Bitcoin. But so were Alice and Bobs Coinbase accounts. We have to find out at what point a Lightning transaction produces a true \"Bitcoin transaction\" - assigning coins to a unique Bitcoin wallet that the recipient controls. Turns out that Lightning transactions are IOUs just like Coinbase transactions. So while a Lightning transaction appears to instantly transfer Bitcoins, in reality it instantly signs an IOU. The Bitcoin are not transferred until some other time in the future (this is the step called \"settlement\"). So where are the actual Bitcoins while all these Bitcoin-IOU transactions are going on? They are held in a Lightning hub. Now \"Hub\" is a word the Lightning devs dont use anymore - they will tell you that Lightning is not \"hub and spoke\", \"but peer to peer.\" \"Hub\" fell out of use with good reasons - hubs are bad. Remember Bitcoin is censorship resistant: any given miner might choose to reject your transaction, but any other miner is free to include it. But if Lightning transactions go through hubs, then any hub might be able to censor transactions between its \"spokes.\" So devs stress that Lightning is really peer-to-peer. It turns out that just because a technology allows peer to peer connections doesnt mean it will form into a peer to peer network topology. We can see that tcpip is inherently peer to peer but produces a strong set of hubs and spokes (do you run your own Web or mail servers?) Lightning works the same way. While the technology allows any user to create a \"channel\" with any other user (making it inherently peer to peer) in practice nobody can leave channels open to everyone they pay. Since opening and closing channels each requires a Bitcoin transaction, it is inefficient to even open a channel unless one will frequently transact over that channel. Since each channel ties up Bitcoins that cannot be spent elsewhere until the channel is closed, then each channel represents a unique cost to hold open. So you cant use Lightning to pay for coffee peer to peer. It would take a confirmed on chain transaction to establish a channel between you and the coffee shop, then a Lightning transaction to pay for the coffee, then another Bitcoin transaction to close the channel. Thats three transactions to replace one regular Bitcoin transaction. You could create a channel and fund it with enough Bitcoin to pay for all possible coffees. That would let you pay via Lightning peer to peer with the coffee shop. But it would also require you to essentially prepay all your future coffees up front. Of course this is not how Lightning advocates expect you to use their payment network. You are expected to place your funds in a hub server. That server will maintain open channels with other hubs. So when you want to pay for coffee, the hub server where you store your funds signs an IOU with the hub server where the coffee shop stores its funds and sends it over to that hub. The \"peers\" never actually transact. So where are the Bitcoin? On the hubs. Not in your control. When the coffee shop owner receives the Lightning transaction, she received an IOU for Bitcoins from the purchaser. The Bitcoins stayed on the hub. So hubs are like banks and Lightning is like SWIFT: you keep you Bitcoin on a hub, and the hub \"empowers\" your Bitcoin to be instantly transactable over Lightning with other hubs, at the expense of having to trust a third party with your Bitcoins. Now its true that I am comparing Lightning to other off chain transactions like Coinbase and that there are differences. In software we have this concept called \"leaky abstractions.\" What this means is that when we try to hide something messy with a simplifying abstraction, something invariably gets lost. A transaction on Coinbase is an example. If Alice sends Bob some Bitcoin, actually performing the transaction is hard: it takes time and costs money to move Bitcoin on the blockchain. But if I create an abstraction of the Bitcoin that Alice wants to send Bob, I can transfer the abstraction immediately and for free, and handle the underlying details later. Bob and Alice can be unaware that the Bitcoin they thought they exchanged were really only symbols in a database - at least until Coinbase blows up. Then it becomes painfully aware that the \"symbol is not the thing.\" A Coinbase transaction is an example of a kind of leaky abstraction. As long as everything works, the \"abstract\" transaction on Coinbase is \"pretty much as good as\" a real transaction on the blockchain. But if something goes wrong, only the real transaction counts. Gold and fiat money are another example. A paper certificate for one ounce of gold really is almost as good as one ounce of gold (better, in some ways). But the symbol is not the thing: people can sell all the real gold making the paper worthless. All of this speaks to the fact that a Lightning transaction - which exchanges IOUs for future Bitcoins that users do not hold in wallets they themselves control - is not a Bitcoin transaction, but a transaction of IOUs. It is an abstraction. Now Lightning isnt a fallible human system like paper fiat. Lightning relies on computer science to theoretically make it impossible to steal Bitcoin or inflate the money supply. Lightning may work perfectly - but its still just IOUs, not actual Bitcoin in my wallet that I control, verifiable by every full node on the network. Any imperfections in Lightning contribute to the \"leakiness\" of its ability to abstract a Bitcoin transaction. In the end, all software engineers will tell you that \"all non trivial abstractions are leaky.\" The less trivial, the more leaky. And the more leaky the abstraction, the less the abstraction is worth relative to a real transaction. A Lightning transaction is clearly worth less than the equivalent on chain transaction. So Lightning isnt Bitcoin any more than paper gold is real gold, and therefore should be considered an alternative money (altcoin) based on Bitcoin IOUs.\n",

      "Separation of church and state. What more need I say? I dont personally find it that offensive, more of a curiosity of like how people saw god in lightning strikes and now see in the galaxies far away (while I think of it more as the sum of all possible shapes and patterns), but maybe it has been overlooked that I have been commanded to increase my perception of value of a social movement which subtley and nonaggressively prints the advertisement for authoritarian religion in general (god above, instead of we could all be equals none above or below), and I do take offense that I must connect my perception of value to an advertisement that I must trust such authority of \"god\", or that I must use such currency that has in the past been of a religious nature however small, and I ask that people separate church and state by not taxing me in dollars and instead in some other nonreligous currency which has been that way from the start. Since I have not met this vision of god referred to, one life form unified, I would not know if I should trust or not or what interaction I may be interested in. I do not believe the universe is so centralized that any set of reality could be accurately described that way, though I do think there are so far unimaginable things out there. Since I define money as \"tradable perception of value\", I request further separation of church and state by not taxing in units of any currency which has ever, for many years in this case, been attached to any religious advertisement. I realize this would reduce the market value of federal reserves claimed assets, being the people in their religious organization, but I dont think everyone opted in to that. We owe something about god? Money is free speech. Is speech taxable? Werent monopolies illegal? When did that change? Why would I have to trust god, as the dollars say? We are all gods, at least in potential, in a physically real way like in the curves of the field some shape. Even if people dont so much care about the religious advertisement, it is a violation of contract by federal reserve, that contract being, in USA at least, the constitution which says congress can regulate the value of money and we have freedom of religion. Maybe some people arent of the religion named on the money they are taxed, that being the trust of monotheism and it being connected with the military industrial complex in excessive ways.\n",

      "The cryptocurrency concept seems as complicated as it is simple... In thinking about what BTC is, and attempting to easily explain to the uninitiated/curious, is there anything wrong with simply calling it a \"ledger\"? A simple ledger (or list) of value transactions being kept track of by countless computers around the world - the BTC you own/sell/buy is simply \"credits\" on this ledger, and the computers (and computer operators) are motivated to keep record of this ledger by earning themselves \"credits\". (and the users motivation to use the ledger is worldwide record of your credits). Seems to me that most everyone can understand what a ledger (or list) is, and the simple understanding of \"credits\" on that list/ledger is equally simple. In fact why isnt the BTC/crypto enterprise named something along these lines? We know what \"mail\" is, so when we developed electronic mail we called it \"e-mail\". Its name explains what it is (short for \"electronic mail\"). On the other hand, we developed a electronic communication network, and designed a ledger for any interested parties to utilize, and called it: \"Bitcoin\"? (consequently followed by the unaffiliated manufacturing of near valueless physical metal \"coins\" which may or may not have a ledger address attached). Seems considerably more confusing than calling this electronic ledger something like an \"e-ledger\". The BTC ledger itself would be specifically referred to as a \"decentralized e-ledger\" and your credits would simply be \"credits\". Maybe Ive got it all wrong? Nevertheless, rant complete. Happy New Year to yall - should be an interesting one for those holding credits on our favorite e-ledger...\n",

And I would like to leverage YouTube if at all possible (to make it easier than dealing with downloaded videos). I was originally thinking about taking the SHA256 of the youtube video URL to generate a private key. Then derive the public address from it and send it a few milibits. Then sweep out the milibits. This basically establishes the existence of that URL with the transaction timestamp. At first I thought this was a clean solution, but then I discovered that Google allows you to change the video, but keep the same URL. So I cant prove the original video existed at the timestamp. I know I can do a SHA256 of the downloaded video file, but again, I do not want to make anyone have to download the video to prove its timestamp existence. Is there a more clever solution using YouTube that I am missing?\n",

Pending government action against Bitcoin, Satoshi has created the perfect asset to preserve wealth of ANY size. 1. Completely known supply, 100% transparent. 2. Fungible. 3. Ever growing liquidity that will likely never stop becoming more liquid each passing month. 4. Even with block size debate Bitcoin is devoid of government mingling 5. Has no transportation issues or issues that prevent you from controlling the asset completely if you so desire. 6. It is accepted almost everywhere and soon will be defacto transaction choice on the planet. 7. Relatively instant transactions confirmed everywhere in the world at once The perfect asset alone is all Bitcoin needs to be wildly differentiated from every other asset you can come up with. There is no other perfect asset, there is no competition (alt coins in your dreams). NOTHING matches bitcoin in all of these areas and it is likely nothing ever will. \n",

      "Hello! For the longest time ever, I have been fascinated with Bitcoins. Despite most of my family members do not understand and essentially disapprove of Bitcoins, few of my friends and myself have understood it, observed it and have been meaning to involve ourselves with it for a very long time. We do not intend to invest all of our money in Bitcoins and live off of it, of course, but we do want to have a fair amount of BTC, at least a constant supply of it so we can perhaps do some cool purchases with the simplicity of BTC. However, we do not know how to involve ourselves with it and we are split between mining for BTC, which is a pretty big investment for equipment and maintenance and just buying BTC from the market. We already have a wallet set up, precautions taken yet we still have an empty wallet nevertheless. This is where I come to you: Should I get a mining rig or simply a bit of BTC to play around? Im feeling the latter is the best option so we can get firsthand experience on jumping into the world of P2P transactions but I still do not know if the best thing to do is to simply surely and slowly buy my BTC supply from the market or use a mining rig. Were willing to own a pretty good mining rig and we are able to take care of electrical costs and maintenance as we plan to keep the rig in a solar-powered contraption, however it may look, that will power it. Is mining still worthwhile and is it still a profitable thing with a good enough rig or should I just buy BTC? Surely, I must be rambling or incorrect on something, so please comment or PM me for any clarifications. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you and have a nice day!\n",

Until then, the five standard types of transaction scripts are the only ones that will be accepted by the reference client and most miners who run the reference client.

      "I finished watching \"The Big Short\" last night (its awesome, check it out) and it got me thinking about our current world macroeconomy again. As I see it, there are many signs pointing to some major financial crises in the future - only postponed by market manipulation, investor deception, and federal reserve \"tools\". Headlines and market insight tell me its already begun:  Chinas stock market crashes,  Chinese currency volatility & likely devaluation,  Chinese housing bubble still hasnt popped,  [Brazil is headed for their worst recession since 1901](  Our federal reserve has leveraged our dollars debt ratio to terrifying amounts,  Quantitative Easing (QE) finally ending AKA the ultra-richs charity bank,  The effects of QE ruined our middle class,  Inflation increased in December,  The looming inflation increase world-wide,  Real unemployment in America over 10%,  US economy isnt growing,  Oil prices crashed,  Housing rebounded while banks still sell CMOs under the name \"Re-Remic\"s (repeating the last mistake),  Im convinced our stock market is going to crash (its already starting),  COMEX (the exchange for precious metals that dictate prices of gold and silver) is controlled by the banks & fed. Selling multiples on futures for gold not in a vault,  The rich are buying stock in companies related to moving Chinese money internationally,  The rich (and countries like Russia & China) are stocking up on real gold and silver,  Potential crash of the EURO,  Potential crash of the USD,  Governments defaulting on their debts,  The continuous expansion of rules to keep you from withdrawing from your own bank account,  Banks potential seizure of citizens money like in Cyprus,  Militarization of our police forces,  Beginnings of new gun regulation (may be unrelated though),  One major crash will stick the \"bill\" on citizens again and fuel the wealth inequality (compound that wil a potential inflation spiral and were back in The Depression or worse) Im sure this list is just touching the tip of the iceberg and its unsettling. The past few months, I have been buying bitcoin as a hedge on my worries although it isnt a perfect solution. I bought more last night... Im starting to bet big (but responsibly) on my future in it. Given the state of COMEX and gold/silver manipulation, it isnt really even a sound investment to hedge on this stuff either. Im considering shorting stocks as well but I dont really want to touch the stock exchange - it isnt a free market (although my best assumption is that it will crash... hard). I am investing more into bitcoin because, although it is manipulated by whales, it is the closest \"free market\" I can think of. The bitcoin price is most closely correlated to supply/demand compared to anything else. The biggest questions right now have to do with scalability (which Im confident will be resolved w/o issue), political threats, and the lack of education on it/misinformation. When will governments learn that they are ineffective at trying to manage/play world economies like a game? I hope that time comes someday. China could be the ultimate example of this. They did a lot of things right, actually, but its counter-intuitive and destined to fail (as were seeing / in my opinion), How do you think bitcoin would perform in various financial crises scenarios? Im obviously betting itll go up. Regardless, I feel very unsettled by how irresponsible our politicians, fed, and banks are. Do you share any of these same worries? What are you doing? \n",

      "Long Live Bitcoin Hello all, Id like to suggest a solution to the Bitcoin block size in order to have bigger blocks, give continuity and strengthen the network. Many have considered to increase the current block size from 1MB to 8MB, but others think this would be too big and not necessary yet (at least so far). My proposal consists on increasing the block size according to the Fibonacci Sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,...). This means the new block size right now would be 2MB (1 + 1), next 3MB (2 + 1), next 5MB (3 + 2), etc. I propose the first increase now (January/February 2016) and carry out with coming increases when the network says it is necessary, this could be by consensus or done automatically when the block size reach a limit of 80 - 90% of the total size or even go above the current limit (for example). Of course all solutions should be carried out by consensus. What do u think?\n",

But it does not end here, things actually are looking pretty well for an immediate rally today (Asian day), in fact if there is any not randomness in the bitcoin price it has to raise now. Why I think that? First I think we can all agree that the price is dominated by China. There are some debateble evidence that one of the cause of the last micro rally was yuan devaluation. People also argue when the next financial crisis hits Bitcoin will profit from it. Furthermore there is a debateble correlation between gold and Bitcoin. And this brings us to the events of today morning. Because of the yuan unexpectedly dramatic devaluation, after its open the Chinese stock market immediately crashed a 7ish % and halted for rest of the day. Everyone is in full panic mode and gold is up. Now I repeat if the bitcoin price is not completely random, it has to go up now.

      "Bitcoin at its heart is one simple thing: a computer network. UTXOs are not coins, they are notes in a bunch of nodes on a network. They are not in the physical sense ownable, they are controllable, as in the private keys that allow you to transfer control are what allows you to do that. The private key is what you own. You do not own the bitcoins(notes in the ledger), you own the private key controlling them, and the private key is not equivalent to those entries in the ledger. Without the NETWORK, those keys are completely useless. The main purpose of this network is to record and verify and TRANSFER CONTROL of bitcoins on the ledger between different keys. The notations on the ledger represent the currency, the keys represent the control over the notations ability to change. Lightning Network transacts with bitcoin keys. It transacts by updating a balance in a payment channel through exchanging pre-signed BITCOIN transactions, valid on the main chain, signed by bitcoin keys. Most importantly, it transacts CONTROL over UTXO, structured in a way that as long as you are not using Lightning and totally disconnected from the main bitcoin node network, not watching the blockchain, you can not get ripped off. If someone tries to rip you off you can instantly settle the current balance in channel on the main chain, because what LN transacts with is pre-signed bitcoin transactions. Lightning Network is a top-layer way of exchanging CONTROL over private keys and the associated UTXO without having to immediately record it in the blockchain. It interacts with some of the main components of the bitcoin network, fulfills the same function the core does, in a different way to meet different needs, it is bitcoin. It is not a sidechain, which is a completely seperate network that is interoperable with bitcoins network. It is a layer OF the bitcoin network. Say what you want about fee markets, about other opinions you have on how to scale, but this is factual. Lightning Network is bitcoin, it simply has built a secondary way to confirm transactions on top of the core way, and its entire security model is based on being able to settle on that core layer. \n",
      "It has been estimated that in the next few decades, 80% of the workforce in developed nations could be replaced by robots. Blue-collar and white-coller jobs both would be tremendously impacted, and the consequential impact on a persons ability to spend will be equally impacted. So, while we continue making this transition into a robotic driven economy we need to figure out how the human economy will continue to function, drastic change is inevitable. Here is where Bitcoin can rescue us. Right now the big idea that seems to be gaining popularity is the \"Guaranteed minimum income\". But it comes with the caveat that the government will distribute the income. To this I say - \"Keep your politicized dollars to yourself\" But Bitcoin can actually do this much more effectively than any bag of flesh in a suit could hope to. Heres my prototype idea: Robot Displacement Compensation Any time a robot replaces a human-worker, require that robot to be linked to a smart contract which automatically compensates that person with the fruits of the robots labor. A company could survive the PR nightmare of replacing its entire workforce with robots - if they prove that the people replaced are compensated directly by the machine. By using cryptocurrency, machine to machine transactions, and smart-contracts - there could be no possibility of cheating the workers, and it could be instant. \n",

After hanging up I told myself \"How about I take it all and put it into BTC\".. Because of what I have been seeing in the economy already, I knew it would work out, also it is on its way to getting worse, another is because I may be moving to NY and taking all this cash isnt an option. This to me was a breakthrough. This is the first time I have made such a Big and conscious decision regarding such a big amount of money, and for some reason I felt confident that it would be a safe move (Not being anxious that my money would lose value) Then, unexpectedly..

      "I know, we all want anonymity and fungitability, but this makes us blind for how big the risk is that Confidential Transactions sets on Bitcoin. Its a far bigger risk than not raising the blocksize or than raising the blocksize immediately on 20 MB. Why? Because Law Enforcement will never accept this. Right now we are in some sort of equilibrium, where many people in authorities wants to ban Bitcoin asap, but there also are many people in authorities that dont want to ban it but regulate it. Currenty KYC/AML procedures work, not perfect, but they work at least to some degree. When exchanes verify identity, law enforcement can - in theory - connect transaction and identity. When we have confidential transactions in the protocoll, KYC/AML will be completely broken. Theres no way our government will accept this. There will be a ban, I think first in Europe, cause Europa, especially France, already starts to srticten financial controll in response to the terror, than in the USA. If all legal plattfroms to sell Bitcoins are closed, if no shop accepts bitcoins, if buying bitcoins on localbitcoins is a ticket to guantanamo, then your bitcoins will have zero value left. This is a Level-A-risk. Ironical Bitcoin is already very private and there are several methods to enhance privacy.

      "Hello comrades, As many of us did in the few months/years, Im coming here to testify about the shittyness of the banking system in France. Here we go... First of all, the only way I could transfer my money on a bitcoin exchange platform was to sign a discharge of responsibility so if they lost my money they had no obligation to give it back to me. They were telling me \"they didnt know\" where the money was during more than 3 weeks. WTF ?! THEY DIDNT KNOW, I was like... \"Wtf guys, I mean, whaaaat ?\" I had to come over my bank few times a week and they \"didnt know\". Im not even exaggerating guys, I had to threaten them of shutting down all my accounts to get the wire transfer done... Finally, after ONE MONTH AND A HALF, I had my money on the exchange platform. This is becoming crazy and the situation in France is getting weirder and weirder. Because yeah there is more. Ive decided to take back my money from banks, to shut down every account I have, and these guys are talking to me like a child, telling me to come over next week, next week again because they dont have cash etc... I didnt really insisted a lot on this yet (pretty sad I have to insist though...), as I have exams going on currently but if they keep going like that, Ill look forward to sue them. Here is the funniest part guys, Im apparently going to be reported to the antifraud ministry of economy to be monitored. This is the new law taking place the 1st january of 2016 to prevent terrorism funding and money laundering. For Europe things are getting worse, with the last european law taking effect during 2016 (I dont remember when), banks will have all rights to take money from accounts with more than 100,000€ without any restriction and it seems the law allow them to do this whenever they fucking want ! Does it remind you something ? (EXACTLY the same as cyprus banks did). This law doesnt concern me though... But still guys, there all the signs here. Something really bad is coming and I wont have any single penny in a bank account when this will be upon us. Talk to it about your family, get gold/bitcoin/silver and if you dont want to, at least cash out everything you have to put it in a safe, your quality of living is at stake now. TL;DR We have to increase the blocksize limit NOW. Who knows when the \"big crash\" will occur ?\n",

      "Let me start this thread by saying my interest was aroused by this video: Im new to BTC cold storage, so correct me if Im wrong 1.) Armory runs on 2 computers. The offline part of Armory isnt very memory intensive, but the online portion is because it is tasked with downloading the ENTIRE blockchain. 2.) Offline Armory lends itself well to TAILS because the file isnt very big. Online Armory doesnt easily fit on a thumb drive. 3.) But then I found these 512 GB SD memory cards. As I understand, TAILS OS can be downloaded onto an SD right? Is there any reason that I cant download Online Armory onto a TAILS OS persistent volume, provided there is enough memory? Of course, I would have to constantly update the persistent volume, but thats better than having to download the entire blockchain every time I wanted to use Armory. I guess my question is, if Im going to have two computers for Armory, is there some way I could run TAILS on both of them? If I could do that, I would finally feel secure enough to really embrace bitcoin. I might be paranoid but I wouldnt even trust anything other than a squeaky-clean OS with my public keys. Sure its not a direct security risk but privacy risk is an indirect security risk... EDIT: Can the Reddit community provide any tips as to which machines would be most friendly to TAILS and/or Armory? I really feel like I should have a dedicated pair of machines for Armory, I was wondering what kind of laptop other people have used?\n",

      "Every now and then Ill stop by this sub-reddit to see whats going on in the world of Bitcoin. Always with a grain of salt though. Lots of fear, lots of lemmings, lots of losers and even fewer winners. Regardless of what happens, in my very humble opinion (coming from an individual who is a level III candidate in the CFA program and has a 10+ year career in finance) Bitcoin is nothing more than a binary option play with infinite theta. If you dont know what theta is, it is essentially the decay in the time value of an option, seriously go look it up. Ive been trading options for a long time now and if you do it right and dont make idiotic plays, you lose small sums quite often; however, when Mr. Market is on your side you win big. I trade options for exposure to tail end event risks that create the type of volatility that you see with three and four sigma events. Let me tell you this, I dont know as much about the technicalities of Bitcoin. I havent been following the blocksize debate. Ive read threads about foundation corruption, this programmer that programmer, OMG Satoshi was found by Newsweek, zomg CIA tactics, alt-coin this coin that coin, so on and so forth. You know what? I dont give a shit about any of it. If Bitcoin is truly anti-fragile, none of that shit will cause any lasting damage to it. So while the majority of this sub-reddit and other forums are running around like lemmings with their respective heads cut off, towards the cliff of the week that will spell Bitcoins doom, Ive been steadily building a rather large position in Bitcoin across multiple addresses. I control all of the keys so come at me bitches. Bitcoin is that five sigma event that comes around every ten-thousand years. If were all wrong, then Ive just lost my \"binary option premium\". No skin off my back since mentally every single dollar Ive put into Bitcoin is already \"lost\" For the amount of faith that all of you in this reddit have in Bitcoin and the impact it will have on the future if it is successful, it is rather amusing to me how big of a panic circle jerk you all get into when the price goes up or down $50. Take a look at one of many address I control and every address I control has never had a single output. After all, what option trader would place a sell to close on an option that had infinite theta? Id take that trade any of day of the week, only amateurs would be willing to sell that option. \"OMG dont tell people you own Bitcoin or theyll rob you!!!\" Molon Labe biotch!

More hours would be better, and best of all would be if you can run your node continuously.\" My Questions are: How was the minimum of 6 Hours a day for a full node to be left running calculated? Why was this chosen as the minimum? Also, does this take into account the cumulative hours i.e.; ignoring the downtimes in between (if any), or does this calculate considering that I MUST have run the full node at a stretch of 6 hours without any downtimes in between?

      "Hey everyone I am kinda new around here but I wanted to vouch for Dave Bitcoin and its recovery services. I had a very irritating situation going on. When I bought my first bitcoins weeks ago I immediately transferred them on bitcoin-core. In my eager ignorance I was unaware that it implied to set up the whole 50Go blockchains. Thing is : I have a fairly low bandwidth and a not powerful laptop, so the client instillation kept crashing on and on, leaving my coins in the un-synchronized limbo of the software. For some obscure reasons I was also unable to plug my wallet into blockchain.info, whether I copy-paste the wallet in the importation window or dump and import the private key directly (please dont ask for more details I am literally a bitcoins noob). So here I was, feeling stupid, with a unusable wallet allegedly containing 0.4 BTC. After wandering around trying to sort this out, I eventually reached out to www.walletrecoveryservices.com, and Dave helped me out in a very friendly fashion. Because of New Year Eve it took him some days to process the service and because of that he even offered me to not charge me the 20% fee. I was so glad I could eventually get my damn BTC back that I gladly paid the commission anyway, which was btw totally worth the time I had spent to vainly sort this out myself. I know that it a 100% trust-based service and that I have a non-existing history of redditer, so my testimonial is worth what its worth but I seemed fair to me to leave a feedback for his services given the relief it was for me! Merci ! PS. From my experience, I would also advice not to install bitcoin-core 11.2 if you have a week processor and/or a low bandwidth.\n",
      "Bear with me, Ive had a beer or 2. I watched one of Andreas talks a while ago, and he reminds us that a long time ago, we used shells as money. He goes onto explain that it only works for inland communities. You can imagine that one day some partaker in the shell-money system went to the coast and was able to collect large amounts of shells, and then suddenly they are not as scarce as they used to be, in fact, they are everywhere. Just as that enterprising coastal traveler is about to print a \"Trillion Shell\" Note, no one is using shells any more. So this brings me to today, here we stand, using this FIAT \"money\" which works well, as long as no one is able to \"find\" lots of it very easily. Turns out, this guy called the FED found trillions of FIATs on the shores of their computer systems over the last 6-7 years. Here is why Bitcoin is so very useful to us now, because we know when we save a Bitcoin, we will always have a Bitcoin. P.S. I come into the room, theres a bear with me.\n",
      "With SW around the corner and the trade-off between SW SF/HF I was left wondering whether Bitcoin has reached the \"IPv4->IPv6\" level issues already.

If now isnt the right time for a HF implementation of something so crucial as SW... will we ever be able to make any significant changes to the protocol?

No error message, just a blank page. I could only boot tails in failsafe mode (because apparently my graphics card isnt supported) and I wonder if thats whats causing the problem. I went online with tor and went to the live bitaddress page and it seemed to be working, but I assume thats not secure enough. Any suggestions?\n",
      "A core value that has a lot to do with how bitcoin works and why it works is related to the idea of decentralization. We all know this but sometimes we forget. Decentralization cannot be limited only to the bitcoin client. If we had developers that all worked at some central authority this would be just as much of a threat as if a few miners managed to control all the hashing power. There is no reason multiple companies and a diversity of developers cannot maintain multiple or many bitcoin clients. In this manner it will be impossible for one group to control bitcoin in a negative way. All changes would really require a true consensus of the community. The current situation with Core is really quite the opposite. We have a few coders funded mostly by one big company. It is at the very least arguable that this company has interests that could be different than that of the proper functioning of the network. Even if it did not it still poses an unnecessary risk of centralization. Isnt it interesting how Core coders talk about decentralization, but in fact they are really very very guilty of violating this most sacred of principles. A bit on soft forks: they are passive aggressive, and lack true consensus. Nearly anything can be done with these and later eventually people will be forced to upgrade. Hard forks are not the boogeyman they are made out to be (by Core) they are the way the network gains consensus. Even if there were multiple implementations 80% hard forks could be agreed upon in advance. This means there would be no fork until 2 weeks after the consensus was reached. \n",

      "Money with an unstable purchasing power (over time) cannot be said to be ideal, especially if the purchasing power is expected to decline. Central Banks use monetary policy to target inflation for economic growth. There is an accepted “slight” devaluation of our currencies over time. But leaving these governing systems to create their own index for “stability” creates a centralization of power, a(n unnecessarily) security leak in regard to stability of purchasing power. National fiats also get into a position of wanting to devalue to encourage export. The US cant necessarily devalue without changing its role as the (de facto?) world reserve currency. Our Keynesian attempts at stabilizing currencies and growth are doomed to failure, built on naturally corruptible metrics that cannot possibly hope to be forward thinking enough to achieve the intended goal of stability. Hayek teaches us ONLY the totality of the markets could have such precision, information, intuition etc. So “Asymptotically Ideal Money” is this: “Good money” is to be favoured by the markets and this would show up in price, provided we have a universal exchange for getting in or out of each national fiat. Today because of bitcoin, and as adoption grows, citizens of each respective nation has the choice of either their nations fiat, or bitcoin (or any other option available in the future). So even a self interested government, trying to manipulate currency for their own gain (taxation, capital gains etc.) still must respond to the new game this option creates. There is then an asymptotic evolution, where the markets lead the Keynesian/central banking policies in the direction of stability of purchasing power. Ideal Money essentially achieved through either adoption of bitcoin AND/OR national fiats of increasingly better quality in the gresham/nashian sense.\n",

      " I commented to this article the following: \"The block-size dispute... represents a trade-off between the number of transactions the Bitcoin network can handle and its decentralization \" This is factually wrong. Bigger or smaller blocks do not impact decentralization. Decentralization challenges and corresponding security concerns come from design decisions that lead to centralisation, such as storing all transactions forever, having a race for mining, not incentivising decentralization but incentivizing centralization etc. The blocksize limit has the effect of capping the amount of transactions and therefore is about the scalability. Scalability and decentralization are two different problems bitcoin has. Decentralization needs to be addressed via a different tool than blocksize. Folks that argue with blocksize for decentralization are either lying/using propaganda for other purposes, simply do not understand the mechanics of bitcoin or are making wrong associations & logical mistakes (being stupid). I understand that many very smart people are proclaiming the correlation of blocksize and decentraliation (i.e. Szabo, Todd) but that does not mean they are correct. The other thing that puzzles me is: if decentralization is so important why do we not have workshops about the decentralization problem of bitcoin. I wanted to see what the community thinks and maybe a good dialog will emerge.\n",

[Link to last summarisation]( Disclaimer Please bear in mind Im not a developer so some things might be incorrect or plain wrong. There are no decisions being made in these meetings, but since a fair amount of devs are present its a good representation. Copyright: Public domain [link to this week logs]( [Meeting minutes by meetbot]( Main topics discussed where: 0.12 Release candidate Detailed roadmap for next projects Short topics/notes Gmaxwell has asked Luke-Jr to take over as BIP-editor. Hell be working on clearing up the back-log. He [mailed the mailinglist]( for information. All platforms seem to compile bitcoin with C++11 now. Travis still needs a C++11 compiler, which cfields will enable. Segnet will do a backwards incompatible change soon, to change the commitment structure. 0.12 Release candidate - background Bitcoin Core 0.12 is scheduled for release around February and introduces a lot of fixes and improvements. - meeting comments It still needs some more info in the release notes. PRs [7151]( and [7149]( are mentioned to possibly still be included in 0.12 as well as a quick fix for [7098]( (to be written). Morcos feels strongly that releasing 0.12 as is, is pretty bad. Due to the smartfee changes stuck transactions should be really rare, but if they happen its worse than 0.11, as the network more easily \"forgets\" transactions. PR [7312]( \"Add RPC call abandontransaction\" is proposed by Morcos to be a quick-fix to enable users to make their wallet forget about the inputs to a transaction thats not in the mempool. Better solutions should be build for 0.12.1 - meeting conclusion Take a look at PRs [7151]( [7149]( and [7312]( Cfields will work on a fix for [7098]( Detailed roadmap for next projects - background Morcos makes a request for some direction on what sort of timeline projects are on, and what the order of implementation should roughly be. This so theres a concentration of effort and focus. A more clear plan could result in investing resources into the right parts. - meeting comments Jonasschnelli will work on RBF features for the wallet. Cfields is planning to post a request for comments for a network stack overhaul next week. [BIP 9]( versionbits is moved back in priority a bit. Libconsensus refactoring needs a scheduled time to do, as well as C++11. Clang format might not be worth it, if so we need to communicate that it wont happen. - meeting conclusion Everyone that is working on something that they plan to have finished for 0.13 should send wumpus his proposals, so he can merge it into a plan.

      "In his post, Tim Swanson concludes that much Bitcoin transaction activity is related to arbitrage for speculation and that many, many bitcoins are being held on the exchanges -- over $1B USD worth! \"appears that several million bitcoins are being stored on [exchanges]\" When users withdraw, they are simply making a request to the exchange in hopes that the exchange honors that request and broadcasts a corresponding transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. If blocks are nearly full and fees rise as a result, what will exchanges do? If they are currently paying the transaction fee, will they remain solvent doing so with higher fees? If instead they need to pass on the cost of the fee to the customer, will the customers rush to withdraw before fees rise even further ... causing an increasing flood of the blockchain and exacerbating the fee issue? Best advice is probably to move your coins off the exchanges sooner rather than later. Well, thats always been the best advice but this situation with exchanges should serve as a reminder.\n",

Ill reply until theres a consensus Im fucked or its fixed. Bounty still stands. Its been a about 4 years since I used bitcoin. I had 1BTC just sitting in my wallet and I realized I wanted to invest it in something else. I sent it from Bitcoin version 0.3.24-beta (2009-2011 Bitcoin Developers) to coinbase. Read online a little later that theyve changed some parts of the bitcoin protocol and also that the block chain has grown to 50GB! (I dont have that disk space on my computer). Status on both transactions are 0/unconfirmed Upgraded to the latest Bitcoin Core 2 before I realized my mistake (that I didnt have 50gb). So now my 1BTC is in limbo (I know i need to use a lightweight wallet but it seems like a lot of them are a bit fucky as the Trailer Park Boys might say). Heres the data: Status: 0/unconfirmed Date: 12/1/16 18:06 To: 1nVEtg9DZZhQtMwNvmA7AW2zKUjDFs58D Debit: -0.98000000 BTC Transaction fee: -0.01000000 BTC Net amount: -0.99000000 BTC Transaction ID: 090a559af27550f2c990223adf978e254e2c53442298ea95e240191dd8acf4d7-000 Searched for the transaction on chain.so and couldnt find it. Im hoping I screwed up so monumentally that this will be easy to fix as Im guessing the instruction to send the coin never even left my computer. If you can help me resolve this Ill happily give you a $15 tip (in btc). Despite what you might think, Im not rich (lost another 49 btc in MtGox debacle) despite playing around with bitcoin earlier (life has just been a history of unfortunate events and accidents). So part of my comeback plan is using this 1BTC as seed money so I can maybe get a little safety net. OK, sorry for the long winded rant, its been emotional guys. \n",

      " Bitcoin is a currency that makes its home in cyberspace. Not fettered by the value of gold or other precious metals, Bitcoin’s value is instead determined directly by supply and demand. The algorithm that drives the currency ensures that these coins will always remain scarce. In fact, new coins will be minted at a decreasing rate over the next several decades. bitcoins, forex Cynics will note that very few self-regulating systems remain free of corruption, and this may be a fair point given that, in the case of Bitcoin, no one is at the helm. The transactions are recorded in a central ledger, but payments are peer-to-peer. There is no agency in the middle regulating the transaction. Still, the currency is gaining steam in a big way. One interesting facet of the scheme is that citizens of virtually any country can purchase these coins with their native currency. Once transfigured into bitcoins, they can exchange their cash with anyone in the world. That said, there are only around 10 million coins in circulation, and their total value is less than what Facebook paid for Instagram—around $900 million. Keep in mind that although the value of bitcoins has been on the rise, the instrument is as cyclical as any other asset. Challenges Still, it remains to be seen whether bitcoin will be embraced by world governments in the long-run. After all, governments depend on their ability to control their own currency. If some of that currency is syphoned into a cyber-void, a government’s ability to manage public spending debt dwindles. What’s more, bitcoin allows a level of anonymity that most governments are not comfortable with. As the currency gains acceptance, it is likely that central banks will begin putting up a fight. In the end, however, it may be too late. Pandora’s box has been opened, and even if bitcoin is squashed, another cryptocurrency will take its place. If you feel the itch to trade or mine bitcoin, keep in mind that the jury is still out on this type of digital, decentralized currency. On the other hand, there are significant benefits to being an early adopter. “Bitcoin trading values private currency and its rate is constantly changing and experiencing significant increases. It is for this reason that bitcoin trading has gained such recent popularity in the markets.” For more : \n",

      "Ref I was encouraged to make this as an independent post. Merchants accepting zero-conf runs a big risk wrg of double spends, but nowadays they also run the risk that the transaction will never get through due to the transaction fee set too low. For zero-conf transactions its in the merchants interest that the transaction fees are high enough. Bitcoin payments are also in direct competition with other payment methods, where the merchant usually covers the transaction fees. By subtracting the fee from the merchants price and embedding the fee in the QR code / payment URL one can achieve two things in one go: improved user experience (the price you see is the price you pay) and improved merchant experience (bigger probability the transaction will confirm in reasonable time, less probability of a fraudster to perform a successful double-spend attack). Unfortunately it seems to me the fee is not part of the parameters specified in bip-0021, so this proposal will probably require an update of the BIP + code changes in most of the popular wallets. (while updating bip-0021, should probably also add a token to indicate that the merchant doesnt like opt-in-rbf). PS: I wont claim credits for this - I think Ive seen this suggested before. More post scriptums:  the payment request URL should also include a boolean flag indicating the fee should be covered by the merchant, or the attribute should be named something like \"subtractablefee\".  another advantage: For OCDers and other that likes to have \"order\" in their wallet would probably like to see a round amount leave the wallet, or that the outbound transaction matches up perfectly with some other inbound transaction.\n",

      "This block size debate is splitting up the community and really hurting Bitcoin. Both sides of the debate think that their side represents the true Bitcoin. Recently, Ive been thinking that if Satoshi would come back to give us some guidance on what his vision of Bitcoin is, a lot of people would follow it. I know I would, even though Ive previously expressed my views on [small blocks]( Unfortunately, it doesnt seem like Satoshi is coming back. I then started to think that what if Mike Hearn is right in that BitcoinXT is what Satoshi would have wanted? I have never communicated with Satoshi but Mike has. What if Satoshis vision has rubbed off on Mike over time? Then it occurred to me that most of the small blocks supporters (myself included) came after Satoshi. Playing devils advocate, I put together a list of the major core devs, their estimated joining date (that I can figure out), and their view on the blocksize debate. Coincidence or correlation? You be the judge. EDIT: Sorry for summarizing the devs stance as small, medium, and big. I didnt feel like spending the time to get the details of each persons stance. And it wouldnt have affected the point I was trying to make. Its a loose correlation anyways.\n",

      "Back then it wasnt evident that Internet Boom was a thing. So Bitcoin is not just truly bigger invention than the Internet. Its even more: Bitcoin superior to Internet the same way Internet was superior to TV back then in the Internet boom. Bitcoin is technology that grants access to those who never had it, ruining access business which is totally controls the world now. Sports was a big part of the whole media entertainment industry just as example of things which were affected during this change, where media took main role in monetizing the whole sport industry. Internet boom fundamentally changed entertainment industry followed with dirty politics, lawsuits and accusations in a fight of entrepreneurs for a control of owning a domains like MAMMA.com, BROADCAST.com and different kinds of intellectual property rights which just sounds insignificant piece of letters for many, while big business and billions for sharks. Now times change. Knowing benefits of a Bitcoin address will be a bigger deal. Signing transactions and owning private keys will come into fashion to be featured on a quality entertainment media, and will be the attribute of control, which by itself will be significant part of culture and language. Parallels are so evident: if fuel for Internet boom was driven by crazy brains of 25, 30 and even 35 year olds (Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Sergey Brin) who was very efficient in running technological businesses. To be in that business you had to be there in 1990, after that, (10 years later) all spots and attention has been taken by your competitors, in a very unpredictible way, which is like a storm - you never know whats gonna be wiped out on its way, and which kind of houses is sustainable and gonna stay no matter what. Most influential people causing this storm is exactly that people who was 25-year old during the boom, maybe from regular and even poor families, which is the same case right now for current 25 year olds, who know Bitcoins capabilities and global cryptography strengths better than anything else. But in case with TV, Internet destroyed only few media giants. Before the Internet, at 1950, during TV ages, entertainment business was very small, and sometimes only few poor people had access to full set of really good TV channels and you had to be very special to be part of that content and to reveal your point of you (not talking about poorest countries, where sometimes it took 10 years to deliver English content to average poor person just for access of information and entertainment in a third world, not talking about possibilities for interaction - who cares about what poor person in poor country has to say). Bitcoin entrepreneurs right now betting against whole outdated Internet systems worth billions and billions which is a bubble, with bubble boys in center of events like Apple, Microsoft and even Google, and replacing them with Bitcoin innovations & Bitcoin companies. No, Google & Apple is not going to disappear completely, they just going to become less important and less influential. So, lets make this Bitcoin boom happen $$$ Say \"Goodbye\" to the Internet generation $$$ Kudos and welcome to new, free, faster & decentralized Bitcoin generation (Bitcoin-age people)! Good luck displacing those clumsy & outdated bear industries. Bitcoin is not only betting on the big short against Central Banks monopolies on money around the globe. This is about kicking out of business those slow Internet boom beneficiaries whom brands run on their centralized domains with horrible user experience, but great SEO, not bringing full technological value to end user with audience control, greed ROI and relying on their ability to use Internet technology to centralize and sustain their ugly web-sites monopoly / audience control, monopoly of those, who is mostly just intermediaries between people who havent got control & being ripped off by restricted premium access & high fees for their shady schemes for monetizing their SEO traffic all over the centralized Internet business. \n",

      "I’m a long-time coinbase user (over 2years!). At one point I trusted them with a high five-figure amount of BTC. But the last incident made me move most of my bitcoins and probably close my account with them for real. The problem: The multi-sig vault had a bug. It shows an incorrect deposit address. If you send bitcoins to that address, it never shows up on your account. I tried it two times, and you can find the transactions I made below I contacted support on Dec 22. After which I had discussions with 3 support folks. The last response was on Dec 24. The support guy said that they are still “trying to reproduce the issue”. I pinged them on 08 January but still no response. Probably fixed: The bug is now probably fixed. There are two signs for this: When the bug was there, a new address was shown at every page refresh. Which is a bit weird since the hot wallet shows a new address only if you make a transaction. The second change is that the address shown now is a P2SH address and not a P2PK address. So for over three weeks: 1. There was no acknowledgement that the bug existed at some point, or if it is fixed. 2. There was no investigation and refunds on the amounts I did send but never received. 3. There was simply no reply. So “luckily” I did send negligible amounts to these vaults. Had I sent a bigger amount, it might have been in a worse situation with no recourse. I used to be blind to people complaining about coinbase support. I think I got a relatively “cheap” lesson.

      "Ive been following bitcoin for more than 2 years now, and have been following daily ever since. I havent posted much, or joined in on any of the debates/bickering, but Ive gained much knowledge and beliefs by reading opinions from all sides, and heres what I feel! I trust Gavin more than any other mod, and him contributing to multiple different variations is, what I believe, him trying to eliminate the biggest point of failure, which is the control of the evolution of bitcoin to a few devs that clearly have conflicting interests, without saying it maliciously. As for people bringing up past posts/beliefs that Gavin has made about different blocksizes and such, is ignorant to the fact that people, just like bitcoin, evolve and change based on different environmental factors and information, and it is ignorant to expect otherwise and goes against what open-source technology and bitcoin is destined to do. Personally I would rather have larger blocks than a LN or sidechains for scalability. That being said they do have their place, but I dont believe it should be in deciding the size of our user base or the usage of bitcoin. I just want to move away from the ignorance that core has become, and I would rather put my belief into another dev team that has, what I believe, to be good intentions until they make me believe otherwise, as core has.\n",

Now I know that obviously as an artist if you are publicizing that you are receiving bitcoin for your said works you still can and more than likely will receive a cease and desist letter, but what if youre creating something anonymously like fan fiction, or handmade merch for a tv series?

      "The dialogue that has been ongoing for the last few months has been one of universal discourse (prolonged debate). Ive always been somebody who questions the wider context. When I see endless debate on how the block size should be increased, I ask myself why. Why when everybody has the same vested interest in Bitcoin flourishing, is this decision met with so much pain. So, here it is. My theory. Probably based on all the spy stuff Ive been watching on Netflix and Youtube recently. Totally made up by my imagination. [Espionage]( is the practise of infiltrating a peer group for the purpose of sabotage. It is inherently clandestine, meaning that it goes un-noticed by the wider public. Given the very public nature of code commits and BIPs for Bitcoin, most of the activity and debate can be seen as genuine. But what if.... some of the discourse is deliberate and introduced as an act of [sabotage]( and subversion. Actors in the space who hold high influence that are being paid or rewarded to feed false information and fears. Their remit? To slow down or halt the growth of Bitcoins network. Bitcoin and the blockchain network is already the subject to intensive scrutiny from intelligence agencies around the world. Why? It is the most secure and widely distributed, decentralised messaging network in the world. You dont have to go to many bitcoin conferences to meet people whos area of study is security related. Affiliations of people in this space to three and four letter intelligence agencies globally are not that many connections away. [Economic espionage]( is an act of sabotage organised by government backed groups. Their remit is to focus on a collective of industrial groups or areas to undermine economic development within a country. What if, the worlds largest superpowers are fighting for ultimate control, or at least for economic majority control of what many of us already acknowledge as the future of finance... Bitcoin.\n",

      "Theymos and his moderators have been purposefully manipulating the way that comments work in select threads with the goal of making the thread more difficult to read, and limiting the attention certain posts have over others. Before you just dismiss this as just a wild conspiracy theory, I have solid proof that this is true. Ill detail it all here. --- Check [this]( thread out, about Theymos censoring a Bitcoin Classic thread that made it to the front page. I was browsing this thread and trying to read all of the comments, and I noticed I couldnt collapse a bunch of them for some reason. It was really strange to me, especially considering that the comments I could not collapse were all in support of Theymos. Ive also noticed this behavior in other Bitcoin threads where Theymoss dodgy behavior was the center of discussion, so I decided to do a bit of digging. As another reddit user has pointed out [here]( > I like how you changed the sorting order of posts in this thread right before you made that sticky. It shows that you truly want open discussion with fair rules for all opinions. /s Once he noticed this thread gaining a lot of traction he made a sticky and reordered all of the posts so that the ones he wanted people to see would be at the top, and the ones he didnt want people to see would be separated by HUGE comment chains that cant be collapsed due to him adding custom CSS classes to the subreddit, to glitch Reddits collapse comment functionality. The broken uncollapsable comment chains start at Luke-Jrs post, and hes also made the following posts uncollapsable too (the ones directly after Luke-Jrs) to make the thread even more difficult to process, and to give attention to these threads that he deems are supportive of his cause. Give it a try yourself, try and collapse the comment chain: This thread here by Luke-Jr: [\"Moderation is not censorship, and /r/Bitcoin is not Core.\"]( This thread here: [\"Whining about the lack of altcoins promotions from the CEO of an altcoin exchange, news at 11\"]( This thread here: [\"Bye bye Erik. Good luck with your alt-coin peddling and alt-coin promotion.\"]( As you can see, all of these threads have the following applied to their div wrapper (in particular notice the \"collapsed-for-reason\" class): class=\"thing id-t1_cyw6p0h collapsed-for-reason comment score-hidden noncollapsed\" I looked at a bunch of other comments that actually work and noticed that none of those comments have this CSS class attached to them: class=\"thing id-t1_cyw7z1r comment score-hidden noncollapsed\" Notice that \"collapsed-for-reason\" is missing from the above. There are very few people who agree with what Theymos in this post, but the ones that do agree with him have this CSS class glitch attached to them and their comment chains are not collapsable. Thats not a coincidence. I dug into the CSS to figure out what the hell is going on, and this is what I found. [Here]( is a link to the CSS file that is being loaded in that thread, hosted by Reddit. [Here]( is a mirror of it if it happens to disappear, in unminified format so its readable. In particular, [these are the classes]( he added to the Bitcoin subreddit CSS to break the collapse functionality for comments he wants to attach them to. Just to confirm that I was correct, I removed the CSS class on the broken comment chains and like magic, they started working as expected. As you can see, he was even kind enough to leave: \" disable comment hiding\" in the CSS for us, so we can be certain of his true motives. He also aptly named the CSS class \"collapsed-for-reason\". Reason being he wants to manipulate the way that information is digested in his subreddit so that dissenters are not given a voice. So in conclusion, Theymos and his mods have been attaching this CSS class to posts he wants to make uncollapsable, for the following reasons:  To bring more attention to posts that agree with him  To make it extremely difficult to digest information below these long comment chains, because you cant collapse them you have to scroll and scroll to see the comments below them. He also couples this with reordering the comments so that the ones he want visible are at the top of the thread and the ones he wants hidden away are underneath the huge uncollapsable comment chains. TL;DR: Theymos and his mods have been using every trick in the book to manipulate peoples perceptions in /r/Bitcoin. He went to the lengths of creating his own custom CSS bug to disable comment collapsing on comments that are in support of him, and to make threads difficult to digest by moving massive comment chains to the top of the thread and then making them uncollapsable so that people have to scroll for 3 years to read the comments underneath them. Edit: This has also been brought to my attention: -- Seems theyve been caught in the past doing other dodgy things with comments. In particular, hiding deleted comments entirely so people dont know they ever existed to begin with. Edit: A gif of the buggy behavior: \n",
      "Fees dont seem to have gone up to much despite the continued bumping against the limit, they are running about 3.5 to 6.5 cents. But overall fees have been trending up over its history. In the long run arent fees going to rise no matter what? 1. Fees will increment up as needed to replace any losses in the block reward. IE if a miners collected a $100 a day $75 block reward and $25 in fees, and the block reward falls to $50, the miners collectively are going to increase fees to receive the difference maintain the same revenue, the reality is its blended in that Bitcoin price will appreciate but the knock effect is the same. The market will pay it because the overall cost of security is what matters, not what you pay per transaction. 2. Bitcoin appreciation will raise the fiat value of fees. This feeds into point 1. 3. Fees are based on KB anyways and have no relation to fiat value transferred. This feeds into points 1 and 2. As bitcoin appreciates small fiat value transfers may be consumed by the fees alone. 4. Markets will eventually need to stop thinking in terms of fiat value transferred and think in terms of bitcoin value transferred, in which case fees will always remain low. Which is whats happened over the history. Keep in mind Bitcoin fees have been rising despite there never being any pressure from block limits until the last year. So bitcoin is in this transition phase. Bitcoin is going to continue to appreciate, fees are going to continue to go up. I think that the economics of this are being overplayed on both side sides (tiny blockers vs mega blockers) because; In the short-term fees cannot rise in any meaningful way because there just isnt enough demand, and fees are so low anyways. Additionally the Segwit implementation is going to constrain any fee increases, along with other improvements. Also wallets are going to get smarter about fee calculation; if you look through the data it looks like people overpay fees in many instances simply because fees are so low to begin with it really makes no difference if you spend 3 cents or 6 cents or even 15 cents. If you want your transaction confirmed on the next block. But long run, it seems that if Bitcoin appreciates significantly fees are going to rise in fiat terms, $5000 bitcoins could conceivably require a $1.00 per transaction or higher. It seems to me that both sides have it wrong. Additionally No block limit doesnt mean free transactions. Miners will collude to set a limit, its the same thing airlines do. By the same token low block limit at this stage with reward so high, doesnt mean that bitcoin fees are going to be .75 cents a transfer. This post kinda of shows that Bitcoin fees are pretty stable, and the market will find its way.  Sorry about the title typo \n",
      "What are redditors thoughts on blockchain pruning based on a queue that purges old transactions over a set time period. Every year a transaction with a new type (carry_forward) is sent from each wallet address to themselves with their previous years balance. Wallet balances are based on the transactions occurring in the chain for that year added to a carry forward transaction that is validated by being in the chain and also with transactions and carries from the previous years data. If a user makes a transaction Jan 1st at 12:01 am and no balance carry forward has occurred then it would be sent on demand before. Otherwise it could be performed by the client at any time. Other clients could also do it on behalf of other users if they wanted to but there might be a fee required. Each node would store the most recent portion of the block chain but purge transaction records with a current carry forward balance made before X number of years in the past. The longest chain is determined by the number of blocks in the last X number of years. Because the start of the chain will be lost it can be confirmed by storing a hash transaction in the chain each year that is the hash of all transactions the year previous. Clients would store a local copy of these yearly hashes and not allow any new chains that don’t also have the same beginning hashes. i.e. year 1, 2, 3 are no longer stored by nodes. The current chain segment stored by nodes is year 4, 5, 6. The stored chain for year 4 will have a record in it with the hashes of all transactions in year three. Nodes store this and will have more history the longer they run. If the current year is 7 all blocks broadcast will need to be part of a chain that starts with the origin they are used to. In a way the carry forward acts as an aggregator combining multiple past transactions into one on a yearly basis. This would mean nodes don’t need to store all transactions indefinitely. The size of the chain would match transaction volume. Edit: There are more transactions sent over the network with this method but that is the price trade off for storage relief. It also introduces a risk that new nodes could forget the origin of the longest chain and accept the wrong chain so you could add more than two tiers of history using yearly, monthly aggregate hashes to validate. What about paper wallets and inactive users? There would need to be auditor processes looking through the previous years transactions and submitting carry forwards if one does not already exist. It would be cool if this could be incentivized too. Edit: This might also have some timezone issues at the beginning of each year. Where some regions expect one year and others another...\n",

      "1. We all rely on full nodes to keep bitcoin adequately decentralized. 2. Node operators, unless they are mining, derive no benefit from running a full node. 3. Mining will ultimately tend toward a few major players. In the end, maybe just a handful of entities will mine everything. 4. Raising the blocksize helps out each individual bitcoin user (by making transactions cheaper) at the expense of the health of the entire system. This blocksize issue is actually a proxy for the real issue: without an incentive to run a full node, the system is at risk. The core team are trying to solve the tragedy of the commons issue by making the blocks small enough so that running a node is cheap. If running a node stays cheap, then the system can stay decentralized with volunteers. If you solved the issue of decentralization and created incentives for people to run tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands more nodes, then the core devs would likely feel more much comfortable with raising the blocksize. With an incentive for decentralization, there would be no shortage of full nodes. Anyone with a very fast internet connection and good hardware (millions of people worldwide, will have an incentive to run a node). Potential solution: Could part of the block reward and transaction fees be distributed to people who are running full nodes? Perhaps 90% of the block reward/transaction fees go to the entity/group who solves it and 10% is just spread to all full node operators. If that were to happen, I think youd see maybe hundreds of times more full nodes running, raise the blocksize without compromising decentralization and solve two problems at once. \n",

      "Recently, Jeff Garzik [argued]( that /r/Bitcoin should expand to allow new topics: specifically, the promotion and comparison of future versions of Bitcoin. I argue the reverse: instead, /r/Bitcoin should shrink, and commit to banning all conversation about future BTC-versions. Not just their promotion or comparison, but everything. To accompany this change, I set up a new subreddit called /r/BitcoinHardforks, where the only content that is on-topic is \"conversation about future versions of Bitcoin\". This setup has several advantages: 1. /r/Bitcoin returns to being an interesting source of Bitcoin news, and is not cluttered by blocksize posts. Moderators can focus their scarce energies on improving the health of /r/Bitcoin. 2. Those who do want to talk about hard-forking Bitcoin, have a place to do it. This place wont be cluttered by Bitcoin-news of any kind, it will only be about the hard-fork-options themselves (and so it wont reinvent the wheel, and fight /r/Bitcoin for those users). 3. It will be commonly understood, by everyone, that these ideas are \"proposals\", and that this proposals are in an ambiguous state -- none of them are \"official\" Bitcoin anything. Greater clarity means it is harder to hijack Bitcoin, and that hardfork-proposals know what to do if they want higher visibility. 4. /r/BitcoinHardforks will likely have a much smaller readership than /r/Bitcoin, so there will be much less of an incentive to exploit the subreddits popularity for marketing/trolling/ego-tripping. The vision is: anyone who posts (in /r/Bitcoin) about a Bitcoin Hardfork Proposal, is told \"These changes potentially pose a severe risk to users funds, and to the Bitcoin network. Therefore, we have decided not to allow discussion of such changes here (on the more mainstream /r/Bitcoin).

      "Thats about a 6% cost. So-called experts will argue that this is the same amount as the average remittance cost of sending money to the Philippines using traditional channels, therefore bitcoin remittance is redundant and just makes things more complicated and not cheaper for the user. What those numbers dont tell is that 6% is the average number for a $200 remittance. The smaller the amounts, the higher these fees become. I dont even think it is possible to send $6 internationally and have it picked up in cash within minutes. Maybe it is, but expect to pay more than $6 in fees for that. When workers abroad can remit money to their loved ones back home in real time and in small amounts, it eliminates a lot of problems like misappropriation of funds and risks of holding more cash than needed. They can even directly pay their bills or buy mobile airtime credits as well. This is what bitcoin is all about: making things considered unfeasible or even impossible to do a reality. Sending $6.00 across the world, converted to local currency, within minutes, all from a simple web or mobile app. Ideally they should not need to convert to fiat, but were a long way from there. For now, this is a solid use-case for what Bitcoin can do right now. Disclaimer: I am one of the founders of [Rebit.ph]( the company that facilitated this transaction.\n",

Im not going to go into my returns but I continued making larger purchases into the price decline as low as $220 per Bitcoin. These purchases were all unloaded during the recent spike to $500. Buy when others are fearful and sell when others are optimistic. Just like last time, Im here to let you know these are good prices and Im not scared.

If you bought in when I made that post Bitcoin was at $400, Sept 18, 2014. A year and 1 month later Bitcoin hit $500, a return of 20% annualized, and that doesnt include buying all the way down as low as $167 where you could have gotten 300% returns. So, Ill be buying again as soon as I can (no liquidity atm) and in another year or so Ill come back and make another post showing how $370 was a great time to buy in again.

      " Lies, FUD, and hyperbole Part 1 With apologies to the length but Hearn does pack a lot of misrepresentations and lies into this article. >a system completely controlled by just a handful of people. Worse still, the network is on the brink of technical collapse. This is patently untrue as power dynamics within bitcoin are a complex interwoven level of game theory shared by miners, nodes, developers, merchants and payment processors, and users. Even if one were to make the false assumption that Miners control all the power, the reality is mining pools are either made up of thousands of individual miners who can and do redirect their hashing power or private pools with companies controlled by multiple investors and owners. >Worse still, the network is on the brink of technical collapse. If and when a fee event happens, bitcoin will be just fine. Wallets already can adjust for fees and tx fee pressures will be kept reasonable because they still need to compete with free off the chain solutions. Whether the Block size is raised to 2, 4, or 8 MB it will also be fine(in the short term) as long as corresponding sigop protections are included. The blocksize debate more has to do with bikeshedding and setting a long term direction for bitcoin than preventing a short term technical collapse. >Couldn’t move your existing money Bitcoin functions as a payment rails system just fine, just ask Coinbase and bitpay. >Had wildly unpredictable fees that were high and rising fast False, I normal pay 3-5 pennies , and tx instantly get to their destination and confirm between 5 min to 1 hour like normal. CC txs take weeks to months to confirm. >Allowed buyers to take back payments they’d made after walking out of shops, by simply pressing a button (if >you aren’t aware of this “feature” that’s because Bitcoin was only just changed to allow it) RBF is opt in , and therefore payment processors wont accept this if they do 0 conf tx approvals. >Is suffering large backlogs and flaky payments >The block chain is full. Blocks are 60-70% full on average . We have yet to see a continuous backlog lasting more than a few hours max. This conf backlog doesnt prevent tx from being processed unlike when the Visa/paypal network goes down and you cannot make a payment at all. >… which is controlled by China People in China [b]partially [/b]Control one small aspect of the bitcoin ecosystem and why shouldnt they? They do represent 19% of the worlds population. This comment is both misleading and xenophobic. >… and in which the companies and people building it were in open civil war? Most people are passionate but still friendly behind closed doors. The Blocksize debate has spurred decentralization of developer groups and new ideas which are good things. Sure there has been some unproductive infighting , but we will get through this and be stronger for it. \"Civil wars\" exist within and between all currencies anyways so this is nothing surprising. > Once upon a time, Bitcoin had the killer advantage of low and even zero fees, but it’s now common to be asked >to pay more to miners than a credit card would charge. Credit cards charge 2.8% to 7% in the US and 5-8% in many other countries. Bitcoins once had fees up to 40 cents a tx , and for the past few years normal fees have been consistently between 2-8 pennies per tx on the chain and free off the chain. >Because the block chain is controlled by Chinese miners, just two of whom control more >than 50% of the hash >power. > At a recent conference over 95% of hashing power was controlled by a handful of guys sitting on a single stage. Mining pools are controlled by many miners and interests , not individuals. Miners also share the control with many other competing interests and are limited in their ability to harm the bitcoin ecosystem if they so choose. > They have chosen instead to ignore the problem and hope it goes away. Bitcoin core has already come to a consensus on a scaling proposal - and various other implementations are developing theirs to propose to the community. Bitcoin Classic is another interesting implementations that appears to have found consensus around BIP102. >This gives them a perverse financial incentive to actually try and stop Bitcoin becoming popular. The Chinese miners want bitcoin to scale to at least 2MB in the short term, something that both Core and Classic accommodate. Bitcoin will continue to scale with many other solutions and ultimately payment channels will allow it to scale to Visa like levels of TPS. >The resulting civil war has seen Coinbase — the largest and best known Bitcoin startup in the USA — be erased >from the official Bitcoin website for picking the “wrong” side and banned from the community forums. Coinbase was re-added to bitcoin.org. Mike conveniently left that important datapoint off. >has gone from being a transparent and open community to one that is dominated by rampant censorship There are more subreddits, more forums , and more information than ever before. The blocksize debate does sometimes create divisions in our ecosystem but the information is all there and easy for anyone to investigate. >But the inability to get news about XT or the censorship itself through to users has some problematic effects. The failure of XT has nothing to do with the lack of information. If anything there is too much information available , being repeated over and over , in many different venues. >One of them, Gregory Maxwell, had an unusual set of views: he once claimed he had mathematically proven >Bitcoin to be impossible. More problematically, he did not believe in Satoshi’s original vision. Satoshi never intended to be used as an argument from authority and if he does he can always come back and contribute. We should not depend upon an authority figure but evidence, valid reasoning, and testing. >And indeed back-of-the-envelope calculations suggested that, as he said to me, “it never really hits a scale >ceiling” even when looking at more factors than just bandwidth. Hearns calculations are wrong. More specifically they do not take into account TOR, decentralization in locations with bandwidth limitations, bandwidth softcaps imposed by ISPs, the true scale of historical bandwidth increases, and malicious actors attacking the system with sophisticated attacks. >Once the 5 developers with commit access to the code had been chosen and Gavin had decided he did not want >to be the leader, there was no procedure in place to ever remove one. The 45 developers who contributed to Bitcoin Core in 2015 could be replaced instantly if the community wanted with little effort. Ultimately, the nodes, miners and users control which code they use and no group of developers can force them to upgrade. In fact Bitcoin Core deliberately avoids and auto-update feature with their releases at the cost of usability to specifically insure that users have to actively choose all new features and can opt out simply by not upgrading. ... end of part one... \n",

      "Hey folks, Long-time (2011) bitcoiner here. All this instability with exchanges that is happening (Im ignoring todays turncoat incident), is very clearly the result of our (collective) inexperience in managing high volume, value laden, exchanges. It has caused a lot of lost credibility, destroyed value, and good people (new and old) are fearful that they cannot freely exchange - a cardinal sin in my book. It is a failure of the community that we dont address these head-on and have a constructive multilog (dialog->multilog) to discuss the components of a trustless exchange. Secondary to this, what can we do to have a transparent and \"good enough\" set of guidelines that could be implemented at any exchange? Akin to a BTC stamp of approval. Areas of the most importance I see are: - Wallets & Wallet Security - Safeguards/Processes/Checks to reduce x,y,z risk - Transaction Fidelity - Exchange reserve minimums (?) - Code of Conduct for instances of negligence or malfeasance I know there are some people that are crying \"REGULATOR\" when I say this, but we have to come up with something. Something that is thorough, definable, and provides a minimum level of assurance that an exchange is operating within some general guidelines. I liken it to a BIP, but specifically addressing community needs and rules of \"good business\" that could be vitally important to the long-term success of an exchange, or really any blockchain business. So I ask, how can we learn from these experiences as a community? What do you think are the key components of an exchange that illicits some level of trust? What are other areas have been key failure points? What can we do to regulate ourselves? The real problem is, I see these infrastructural problems being ONLY addressed by reggie (regulators), or people screaming that it is a technical problem. But, we as a community havent come up with any concrete guidelines that we can show someone, say \"does your exchange meet these guideline? Do you have certain processes in place to protect against _____, ______, ______?\" or in the worst case \"why didnt you do [notification and/or corrective action] you dumb fuck?\" TL;DR I could be surrounded by a bunch of Crypto-Anarchists that would rather tar and feather me than talk about regulation, but at least when we do it ourselves, were fucking ourselves(unpleasant), and not getting fucked by reggie(asshole destroying). Obviously, certain actions are clearly criminal, and would fall out of the scope of enforcement for a \"BTC Self-Regulatory Coalition\", but we can reduce the occurrences of these malefactors and shitty instances. For the people saying \"We cant even do this for software updates, let alone exchanges...\" I say there are 2 different scopes, one at a technical/code level, and one at a systemic level. We arent comparing apples to apples.\n",
      "Helllo, /r/bitcoin ! So, Ive been researching Bitcoin, and I think it would be interesting to get into. It could be a useful learning experience, and it also just seems really cool.

Ive looked at localbitcoins.com, but 1. Ive heard they were rather slow, and 2. Id prefer to be able to buy portions of Bitcoins. I cant afford an entire Bitcoin, particularly with the higher prices they charge. So, what are my options? Ive heard Coinbase merely requires you to verify your bank account, and Ive been looking at a student checking account.

      "Ive recently started learning about bitcoin, and bought some right before this Mike Hearn thing. I love the idea of bitcoin, but Im curious as to whether it is ever really possible to achieve widespread adoption and still uphold the fundamental, ideological goals of the currency. There are two things I dont really understand: First: why is decentralization so important? What power does the consolidation of mining power give the owner of those nodes? Could it eventually lead to malevolent manipulation of the global economy or something? How would this occur, from a technical perspective? Second: Assuming theres a good answer to my first question, and decentralization is an absolute requirement, is it possible? The gist Ive gotten at this point is that increasing block size is necessary for scaling, but it means only expensive hardware can be used to mine. I guess this means fewer parties have the capital to start a profitable mining operation? and I guess that means fewer parties are in control of the changes that are made to the software? So what are the hardware limitations for mining? Why cant you do it on a personal computer, not for profit, but to claim your vote as a bitcoin user? Isnt there some way to allow for smaller nodes or something that can reject or verify transactions but dont have to run the full software or something? I read somewhere that the bitcoin mining network was something like 300 times more powerful than the largest super computer (this statistic may be completely wrong), so why can it only handle 5 transactions per second or something ridiculously small like that?

      "The insidious way that a cryptocurrency grows is still not understood by even some of the most stalwart participants. As long as there are cells in the body that will engage with the virus, it doesnt matter if some cells opt out. The thing will still continue to grow. At best, you can possibly quarantine the growing network but all it takes is the smallest leak and the rampage begins anew until the rest of the whole is forced to either integrate the virus or wither away. There is only one thing that can stop Bitcoin at this point, and that is a more highly evolved virus. The age of cryptographic expansion is upon us, just as surely as the age of rocks and water ended the moment the first life appeared on this planet. Rocks and water cant kill life - only a better form of life or total apocalypse can kill life. In the absence of total apocalypse (such as food chain collapse) then the only thing that can stop Bitcoin is a better Bitcoin. But cryptocurrency wins. That much is assured. \n",

      "You can [read the link here]( - I think it was very interesting to read a miners perspective on the blocksize discussion. Curious what the community thinks about his comments, which are below: All. Maybe e-mail is not the best place to do this, but there aren’t many better choices that come to mind right now. Please feel free to quote me and forward this to anyone you see fit. You may even Post it on Reddit or other forums or simply ignore it. To anyone reading this who was not on the original To: list. It simply means that you were not at the top of my inbox and nothing else. no one has been excluded on purpose at all. We are clearly facing a crises like we have never faced before in the bitcoin echo-system. It appears to be completely caused by humans this time. It should be seen as a success issue, even if it’s not a nice problem to have. Bitcoin is, as I hope you all agree, still very very small on the size of global acceptance. We have a long way to go before it actually realizes its true potential. I personally believe that bitcoin can become a great system for many things in the future. We may all have different ideas on where Bitcoin is going but I don’t believe for one second that anyone here will want it to stop and stay exactly where it is. The issue is by doing nothing we are actually forcing it to stop growing and stay where it is. We have on-boarded about as many users as we can. There simply is no spaaaaaace left to expand bitcoin. There are many competing ideas there are many smart people and possibly to many ideas. The fact remains the same: Most of the latest development ideas coming out are not addressing our issues this time. So it will fall back on us to protect what we have built and let it expand into what we think it can become. So I propose that we jump to 2mb in the Bitcoin classic idea. Not only will this allow us to expand bitcoin and on board more users, it will also show that: 1. We will protect our investments and businesses. 2. Sound economic rules govern bitcoin businesses and not just ideological ideas. 3. Under pressure we can make tough decisions that are for the best of bitcoin and not for any one individual company. 4. The ideas and fixes the development team produce need to be more influenced by the economic requirements we have, not just the technical ones. Now for the other maybe good maybe bad things 1. It will cause more rifts in the development teams. 2. It will cause us all to go through the pain of a hard fork. The lists above are not meant to be extensive or exhaustive and there are many that can be added to either side, but the main point is this: It’s no longer really a choice to simply stand still and wait for others to fix this problem. I propose that we all simply stand up and stand behind bitcoin. Allow it to grow more in the simplest way possible, and I can’t emphasize enough how important simple is to this process. Humans are making this complex we don’t need technology to make it more complex. So with the above said: We will be changing our code to run 2mb bitcoin classic ASAP, please join me in changing your code to run the same or public show your support. Thanks, Sam Med vänlig hälsning  Best regards Sam Cole KnC \n",
      "Its my favorite quote, and its supposed to be from Satoshi: > If two developers can fork Bitcoin and succeed in redefining what \"Bitcoin\" is, in the face of widespread technical criticism and through the use of populist tactics, then I will have no choice but to declare Bitcoin a failed project. Bitcoin was meant to be both technically and socially robust. Mike Hearn giving up is sad, but I dont want his vision of Bitcoin: if people can just change the blocksize while so many people disagree, Ill give up right away because it will show that its pretty fragile. And if bitcoin is so fragile that a group can change the block size within a few months, whats next, upping the limit of the maximum supply?! Id rather see those people leaving the boat. Its too soon for bitcoin to be replacing VISA, nothing is in place, too bad for the investors thinking it would, as of now its mainly a commodity and Im fine with having to pay a fee to have my transactions confirmed faster. In a few years, it might be ready to be a currency though... but not now as the debate shows (I use it as a currency when I can, but its tough to find places). So thanks for all the people (core devs, [r/Bitcoin]( mods) shielding bitcoins from all those tentatives to change it, there is a big silent crowd with you. People put time and money into the bitcoin that exists now, not the bitcoin some people want. \n",

      " Satoshi predicted big mining farms in the early days, than he would talk about the \"longest chain\" when asked about consensus. What is the longest chain? It is nothing more than the one most people are using, right now it is the chain produced by Bitcoin Core client. Even if most miners do not switch to another client at first, they will soon have to switch after most users cause the previous chain will quickly degrade in usage and value until it dies and we get a new longer chain. When you are using Bitcoin Core or an alternative client of the same chain you are giving one vote to it, if you instead start running and using Bitcoin Classic or something else thats where your CPU vote is going to.\n",

      "Bitcoin has created an immutable, incorruptible, and practically indestructible data source. This never existed before Bitcoin. Book burnings, revisionist history, failed hard drives, and 404 errors have happened and information has been lost. Using the blockchain as a data storage device is perhaps the most important invention for information keeping since paper. Perhaps 21st centurys lasting legacy will be keeping information safe from corruption with Bitcoins blockchain. We are starting to see the inklings for using Bitcoins blockchain as a data storage device. There are multiple notary apps like Uproov and Block Notary storing non transactional information to the blockchain. has been around for years and is a new app to save messages in the blockchain forever. We are just getting started, this will continue to grow. You may argue that we shouldnt use Bitcoins blockchain for this. Put it on a different blockchain. Keep our blocks small, stay decentralized. To this I say, no. I say no for the same reason I dont own some crappy altcoin. Trust. Bitcoin is the best. I dont trust another blockchain to safeguard my information in the same way I dont trust altcoins to safeguard monetary value. So why is the Core ignoring this use case? When I first understood what the blockchain was it was one of the first things I thought of. Do they not see it, not care, or something else? I believe Bitcoin should foster this use case because it could account for billions of transactions and spectacular user growth. Lets not off load it to some other blockchain. Of course if we use Bitcoins blockchain as a way to store data we are going to need much faster growth in block size. I please hope Core dev take this into consideration when creating new proposals. \n",

      "If you were a bank or government and you saw a threat from a peaceful group bent on social change that would challenge your power what tactics would you employ to subvert and divide such a challenge? Occupy has first hand experience with agent provocateur. If you ever get a chance to talk to someone from Occupy, theyll tell you about how they organized in small groups to discuss what actions to take. They would then switch up groups and it became apparent who the provocateurs were and would work to neutralize the damage these individuals could do to the consensus of the Occupy movement. (e.g. They decentralized their operations to thwart outside manipulation.) The documentary \"Mirage Men\" (available on Amazon Prime and Netflix) shows how the USG agencies set about feeding UFO disinformation to people who had recorded lights in the sky and radio signals that would reveal classified experimental aircraft. The idea was to make those who had recorded these things believe they had recorded UFO craft or intercepted UFO radio signals. The disinformation campaign resulted in the UFO community being unable to discern truth from fiction and those who believe in UFOs were classified as crazy. Any rational investigation was rendered useless because of this disinformation. The bitcoin community has to realize that power is not going to play nice and will seek to undermine the consensus. One way to do that is to target key players in the bitcoin community. Remember that Satoshi stopped messaging once Gavin gave a talk to the CIA about how bitcoin worked. Its not un-imaginable that he was identified and threatened. Its also possible that the bitcoin programmers or organizers are being manipulated, threatened or bribed to cause problems. Another is to keep key actions from happening and to waste peoples energy and motivation. If bitcoin is to succeed, its community needs to start thinking about how power is not always about the use of force or laws. There needs to be ways to identify manipulation and to thwart its effects. There needs to be ways to work around individuals who obstruct progress.\n",

      "I myself, like many people, were saddened to see the news about Mike Hearn leaving and then seeing the price dip today to below 400. But... this needs to be happen, and heres why. I agree with Mike that there is a huge rift that needs to be resolved within the bitcoin community. Between the bickering, censorship, and endless blockchain debates, it doesnt look good to anyone looking in from the outside. Someone posted a meme about the drop, and about how bitcoin is dead, and that this is just a normal thing. But think about that... should it really have to be normal? Should it be normal to expect a technology with SO much potential to be riddled with bickering and infighting and then at the same time, have the nerve to aspire to compete with many of the worlds currencies? Mike is right about the bitcoin community. At this point, it shouldnt be about the bickering or the size debates, it should be about what we can do as both enthusiasts, developers, venture capitalists, etc... to get the attention of the rest of the world and convince them that yes, this is the technology that will change the financial world! Because to anyone looking in from the outside and trying to make a decision as to whether the should invest their millions and dedicate the resources of their infrastructures to supporting this exciting new technology, they are going to look in and say \"No! These people are too damn caught up in arguing about megabytes and censorship rather than changing the world\" As someone who has been a lurker for many, many months and has invested in bitcoin, I have found myself frustrated many times, especially when interacting with the bitcoin community. Which, when I do come out from lurking and interact, more often than not, its been a negative experience. So, are we going to take this as a wake up call? Or are we just going to go on and continue down the same road that weve been traveling for the past year? \n",

[Gold can take forever to confirm.]( and [congestions occur for buyers too.]( Gold did become valuable and the dominant form of money because it was also fairly easy to melt and process, so speed of transactions are important but above else gold was scarce and trusted to maintain its value because of that. So when I see congestions in the network I think about Germany and Chinese people waiting hours in line to buy some gold and I think about how devs are working hard to maintain the decentralization, its permissionless use and above all else the financial sovereignty of all its users.

We deeply regret this inconvenience, and will attempt to resolve this situation as soon as possible. All Bitstamp accounts remain safe and secure. We have not been officially notified of the reason for this action, which we view as unjustified. We are not aware of any misuse of our services involving any Russian customer. Bitstamp poses no threat to the security of Russia or its economy. Bitstamp is a recognized leader in operating a safe, fully compliant exchange. We are attempting to contact officials in Russia to determine why they have taken this unfortunate action.

We do not know much, but we will let you know what we lea rn, as we learn it. Please contact us at support@bitstamp.net We suspect that the ban is related to legislation pending in the Duma of the Russian Federation. For more background, see: The proposed legislation would broadly ban the domestic use of BTC, and appears to criminalize use of an international exchange such as Bitstamp. To ensure compliance with the new regulatory regime, protect affiliate service providers, and most importantly – protect our valued customers in Russia – Bitstamp has decided to temporarily block access to its website from Russian IP addresses until we can assess the situation with more clarity. Again, we regret this inconvenience, but we do not want to expose anyone to possible fines or criminal sanctions by the Russian state. Best regards, Bitstamp team I am a bit surprised Bitstamp (with its Slovenia/UK jurisdiction) is so concerned about Russian laws, but it’s up to them, they may be paranoid. OK. But even so, their arguments are not valid. If Bitstamp is lost here I will try to clarify some things for them:  Bitcoin is NOT banned/prohibited is Russia.  Access to Bitstamps website is NOT prohibited by Russian Roskomnadzor (Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications), check here  New Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses is being discussed now. There is a draft which is far from being finalized and accepted. The implementation of the new Code is planned for 2017.  The Code draft contains new articles about “money surrogates”. Bitcoin is not mentioned there and by many interpretations it is an exempt from “money surrogates” because currency legally regulated in EU or UK is not considered as “money surrogate” (this article in Russian explains this in more details There is absolutely no reason to ban Russian customers from accessing the site.

      "Why are we allowing CEOs of centralized companies join forces to completely change the consensus model of Bitcoin? I know some of you think it is broken with Core, and maybe you are right, but just look at the reputations of those involved. I look to the solid reputations of the engineers of core; such as the diligent & persistent contributions of Greg Maxwell from the Bitcoin project, to many other worthy open-source software projects, to the storied cypher-punk history of Dr. Adam Back. What does the other side have? Gavin comes out of no-where, with no notable history of freedom-enabling software projects. Put simply, he has not championed anything worthy before Bitcoin. Garzik comes out a bit cleaner than Andreessen - but seems more of a political type: blowing back and forth on popular sentiment. I like his ideas, but his alignment makes no sense. Then there is the circus that is CEOs of Bitcoin companies, rich men who want to dog-pile on whatever code-change takes authority away from the Core developers... Months ago XT was the CEOs way forward, today it is Classic - what will it be tomorrow when Classic fails? What is the rush? If there needs to be a rush, doesnt that put into question the viability of the whole project? If you need to rush its simply a money grabbing motive - we are concerned with reshaping the financial world - not making billions of whatever fake currency they think matters. Think, what are the consequences of taking commit authority of the code away from the actual developers? Changes like red-lists, data-mining, mandatory identities (AML/KYC), inflation, and others are totally possible if you give the CEOs of the world direct influence like they are grabbing for right now. CEOs arnt developers, they probably cant even instruct a computer to repeat \"hello world\" - they are not the ones you should be following. Unless all you want is VISA 2.0\n",

On the one side we have these clowns trying to argue against every new feature and on the other side we have perhaps thousands of dedicated people doing a great job developing and working on bitcoin. So what do you think will be the next outburst from the three stooges? I know they are still hard at work with there current plans but Im wondering what they will do next. \n",
      "Ive seen complaints about replace by fee, since it \"breaks\" zero confirmation transactions, but they were never meant to be secure to begin with. However, I think I came up with a solution to make accepting them safer: Use a smart contract to publicly post bitcoins which can be burnt in the case of a double spend. This proves that the poster has a big incentive not to double spend up to the amount of the bond. Procedure: Alice has an address A with a balance. She wants to buy something from Bob in the future. Bob uses address B to accept payments without confirmation. Alice creates a transaction for X BTC with the following script if presented with two distinct transactions signed by A that use the same input and have distinct outputs (i.e they differ in more than just fee), exactly one of which is to B, make the balance spendable by B. otherwise if T time has elapsed, make the balance spendable by A. She waits for this transaction to appear in the blockchain. Note that this step can be done in advance. When she wants to buy something, she creates the transaction S sending Y BTC from A to B. She sends the transaction to Bob. Bob verifies that  S is valid and sending the correct amount  There is a bond already in the blockchain corresponding to the right address pair with X >= Y and time T sufficiently far in the future. If all goes as normal, S enters the blockchain, Bob gets his money from S, and after the bond expires, Alice gets the money from the bond back. If Alice tries to doublespend by creating transaction S, Bob uses the transactions S and S to collect the bond, getting his money back. Note that this procedure requires deciding on the addresses in advance, but it doesnt require deciding on a transaction value or time in advance. Therefore, it can still be used for speedy purchases with some limitations. Edit: I just realized that its not actually possible for a script to parse transactions without the banned substring opcode. I guess this is a good argument for reenabling it. \n",

There are natural economic enemies to face, incentives for traitors to turn cloak, by its very nature The Blockchain demands to be attacked so that it can prove its worth and justify our trust in it. When enough people in the world no longer _have_ to implicitly trust central authorities or each other somehow that changes the world in some bizarre ways that might actually help us to get along easier and become happier in bulk!). Dozens of mining companies, pools, and individuals are putting enormous resources, time and effort into paying the (pick an analogy) mortgage, insurance premiums, security fees, etc. on our collective hodlings. In many cases depending on market whims these groups and individuals may be operating pro bono or with speculative losses for sustained periods of time. All so that the most secure blockchain in the world will maintain high levels of security required to allow safe rates of organic adoption to proceed in a calm forward moving fashion. I applaud the heroic work done by the mining and node operating portions of our community. Dont be surprised when more cloak-n-dagger stuff happens and then later when the warfare starts coming more and more into the open. Desperation (or mania) will certainly end up driving some actors into strange behaviors beyond our collective ability to speculate.  END BRAIN DUMP  TL;DR - Enjoy the show!\n",
      "Thinking as if i was a central banker who wants bitcoin to fail or control bitcoin. One way to harm bitcoin would be to create chaos in bitcoin core development so that it cannot improve technologically. you would probably need to control only a few core developers so bitcoin development will be locked. that is why you see spamming in dev mailing list and non-productive arguments between developers to slow development down and create a barrier to entry. next i would spam the block chain to sell the idea to the general public and miners that we need to increase the blockchain limit ASAP. this costs a trivial amount of money. next offer a great harmless and logical solution with fewer more centralized developers on banks payrole. ie. bitcoin classic/xt/etc... increasing the blockchain faster than what technology can handle can also centralized the miners which would benefit the bankers too.

      "Relevant Footage, from the \"The Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings\": What Charles Cooper (R3) has done here is strike the bedrock of what constitutes a decentralized protocol with the shovel of a stupid question (i.e. \"who do i call?\"). Who does anyone call when they have an \"internet problem\"? Answer: Typically third party services that use that protocol, and provide value add (like BitPay, etc.). Its irrational to conclude that a protocol is not useful (does not have utility) simply because it is not organized as a hierarchical institution with a call center. It is, instead, placing the utility in the commons, where businesses and entrepreneurs can add value and provide risk mitigation. This is similar to how your employer may use an email provider, instead of building and supporting its own (though it likely could). And, in exchange for that, it gets the benefits of leveraging the protocol while minimizing certain risks. When one debates like this (as Charles Cooper has), he or she immediately exposes their ignorance. It isnt that his other opinions on the topic can be immediately dismissed, but their due attention is certainly to the left of the mean.\n",

      "What is Bitclub Network ( BCN ) Affiliate? I have done a lot of research for Bitcoin buy and sell, bitcoin mining, bitcoin investment and affiliate marketing online; Finally I have come up with my unique analysis on Bitclub Network Affiliate! I have been running own business for the last 20 years and been searching for trusted online businesses for decades. Let me explain why I believe Bitclub Network will be of benefit to you. The BitClub Network website domain (“bitclubnetwork.com”) was registered on the 22nd of July 2014, however, the domain registration is set to private. The BitClub Network website itself is being hosted out of the Netherlands, without more information however it’s not clear whether this is also where the owner(s) of the company are based out of. As always, if a MLM company is not openly upfront about who is running or owns it, it is truly trouble you to think long and hard about joining and/or handing over any fund to invest in it. The BitClub Network Product Line BitClub Network has no retailable products or services. BitClub Network is focusing in Bitcoin buy and sell, Bitcoin mining and Bitcoin investment business. BitClub combined the power of crowd funding to bring you a very unique and timely opportunity in the Bitcoin industry. By using their expertise they are able to build a profitable mining operation that uses an affiliate payment structure to leverage the earning potential of members. The concept is very simple! You purchase mining equipment that is used to mine Bitcoin and BitClub pay you daily on your share of all Bitcoin being mined. When you share this opportunity with other members and they make a purchase you will also get paid recurring commissions on all Bitcoin mined from their purchases. BitClub operates two mining locations with the fastest growing facility located in Iceland. This facility is open to the public who meet certain qualifications for visitation. Our mining pool is open to public so that anyone who wants to contribute hashing power can easily do so. BitClub purchase all mining equipment which allows BitClub to retain full ownership and easily sell the hardware in the secondary market when it’s nearing the end of it’s peak cycle. BitClub swap these out for newer and more efficient machines. Each time they liquidate an older batch of equipment our members have a chance to take possession of the miner if they choose. For more details Click Here. Every BitClub member helps contribute to the operations of the mining pool by “chipping in” Bitcoin to pay for it. This repurchase strategy is what allows us to continually expand and purchase more mining hardware. to read more , pls check out this link: \n",

      "Received this spam... Is ether really trying to shotgun therapy itself down everyones throat? Like what the hell is this crap coin trying to do? Is it really having a positive effect for the coin? Please dont read the whole thing lol I read 8 words. I assume everyone got this message? Hello from marsdendoreen sent 11 hours ago I am sending you this message because the crypto community is too heavily censored, please read carefully. The original of idea bitcoin is to create a decentralized money system that prevents censorship and being shutdown. Proof of work seemed like a good way to achieve that. The real power in the bitcoin world is helt by the miners, as long as the mining process is properly decentralized bitcoin will be decentralized. But real world competition caused many cracks to appear in this model, the first flaws that appeared were pooled mining (centralizing power with mining operators), then came ASICs (Centralizing power with mining operators with good industry connections), then came cheap electricity + latency issues (Centralizing power with mining pools with access to cheap electicity and low latency to others big mining pools). These pressures has essentially caused mining to be centalized mainly in China because there they have cheap electricity, good industry for creating ASICs and low latency to other chinese mining pools (and high latency to the rest of the world). One important thing to keep in mind is that bitcoin itself can evade capital controls and move seamlessly accross borders. But mining equipment cannot. It would be easy to confiscate all mining equipment in the country and use it to destroy bitcoin. So what is the solution to this problem? Proof of stake is the solution because it removed the physical element and allows network voting power to move seamlessly accross borders too. Traditional Proof of Stake contains some flaws like the Nothing at Stake problem. But the new algorithm designed for proof of stake in Ethereum solved all these issues. The bitcoin developer community has proven that it is unable to make even small changed to the consesus algorithm. So completely switching to a different model is never going to happen. If you are willing to open your mind and learn about how Ethereum will beat bitcoin by being far superior to bitcoin watch the videos of Devcon1 Bitcoin is doomed and Ethereum will replace it. Obviously most people involved in Ethereum are aware of this. But for most other people it is not so obvious. But it is hard to convince the masses because they are not reading enough information about Ethereum, either because of censorship in subs or because of denial. Therefore I think it is the mission of each of us to get the word out. Only by saying it often and giving clear examples we can teach the masses what we already know. Try to reach at least on uninformed person every day. (If you lack ideas, just post the link to this post in different reddit subs with target audience). First of all it is important to remind people that Bitcoin was also once small, and that people also did not believe in Bitcoin because they couldnt imagine what benefit it would give over conventional payment systems. That perception changed dramatically for bitcoin and the same will happen to Ethereum. It is important to emphasise this because people often use the psychological principle of Social Proof to make decisions in unknown situations, this is currently working against Ethereum, the underlying reasoning is, \"If Ethereum is so great why is it so cheap?\", \"If Ethereum is so great why is everyone talking about Bitcoin?\", \"If Ethereum is so great, why are the smart people X, Y and Z not invested in it?\". Second of all it is important to emphasise that not only is Ethereum a crypto that offers a whole new concept of the decentralized web, it is also better than Bitcoin at being a currency for payments. This is easy to show by explaining a real world scenario. Imagine the perfect crypto currency, obviously it should be possible to re-implement the most convenient payment systems used today using that crypto currency, and doing so in a decentralized way, with no added fees or middle man. It should be able to behave very much like cash in being able to spend it quick and easy. The most similar electronic product that offers this is the anonymous tap to pay, prepaid payment card. It is easy, it is anonymous, it wont be hacked like phones, it has the ability to limit exposure to compromise by having limited balance that automatically recharged and the end of the day. Implementing this in Bitcoin would not be possible because the small chip in the card is not connected to the internet, and sharing your private key is a security hazard. But what if your wallet/contract could use asymmetric encryption to accept a different secret payment key on every payment. This way it is possible to implement the payment with a touch to pay card in a secure way. In Ethereum it is also possible to program a contract to recharge a wallet at the end of every day for added security, It is also possible to automatically exchange Ethereum for a token that is backed by a stable currency for those merchants that are worried about exchange fluctuations. Third of all it is important to note that Bitcoin is never going to be implementing these changes. Look how hard it is for them to implement a blocksize increase. Changing the scripting language to Turing complete would be a far more controversial change. One that the miners will probably never agree to this. And also keep in mind that quick payments need either zero-confirmation transactions or fast blocktime. So if Ethereum has the potential to implement the most convenient payment system imaginable but Bitcoin cannot then one can only conclude that Ethereum will win in the long run. Bitcoin will die like Myspace, and Ethereum will become the golden standard. \n",

      "Some principles:  Bitcoin always uses the longest valid block chain.  Consensus rules define what is a valid block chain.

The Bitcoin parties have different values and opinions. As in most democracies, some can be reconciled and some can not. They also have their share of supporters and backers, both large and small. Ultimately, the electorate decide. Although I personally support the direction that Bitcoin Core is taking, I, for one, now welcome the rise of Bitcoin Classic. The emergence of a credible alternative demonstrates that Bitcoin is growing up. As Gavin blogged a few days ago, multiple strong development teams can only be good for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a community, an economy and in some ways a political system. Up until now, it has been a dictatorship (which I believe was necessary) but now it is becoming a democracy. I believe all the main parties will seek to implement features from other clients, once they have been chosen by the economic majority to validate the longest chain. Some more extreme parties may choose not to do this at which point they will be marginalised. This is what happens with political parties in most democracies. Anyone can run but more centrist attitudes will be more likely to attain or retain power.\n",

      "It seems the scaling discourse has consolidated and there are now 2 major visions of how to handle things: the Bitcoin Core roadmap and Bitcoin Classic. The Core roadmap is signed by a very long list of developers and is a collection of great and important changes. It has support from one part of the Bitcoin community but does not include an immediate block size increase, thus getting rejected by another part of the Bitcoin community. On the other hand Bitcoin Classic is forming around the idea of having a 2 MB block size increase soon. Classic will likely be based on Core master, so the only big difference might be a 2MB block size limit. Support for Classic is growing by the day, including a prominent list of miners, companies, developers and a Slack team with around 500 members. Both sides have their pros and cons, which have been discussed at length. I personally would prefer having a united Bitcoin community working on the same vision with full powers. So what about a middle ground: include a 2MB hard fork in the Core roadmap. This could be a way to join forces again. \n",

Free speech is one thing, but if for example Tim Cook, a respected figure associated with Apple, resigned tomorrow and declared publicly that Apple is a failure, would there not be repercussions for him for such irresponsible actions? It would cause Apples share price to drop, causing financial loss, a PR catastrophe, tarnishing their public image built up through years of work and trust and most likely the ruin of many peoples lives. Sure, Apple, like Bitcoin will survive, but its an unnecessary callous action that will cause harm. Its irresponsible no matter how you look at it.

      "So far, 0-conf payments for regular every day payments has been working flawlessly. Yes, theoretically it was not safe without awaiting a few confirmations. But theory≠practice and in practice, it simply works. For a normal payment, its practically impossible to enforce a double spend. Many have tried, virtually zero have succeeded. Or actually zero in fact, except a few very exotic edge cases (dust, ridiculously low fees, and other easily distinguishable txs that are typically not being relayed very well, including Peters own recent example). Now with Replace-By-Fee, this all may change. People seem to be stubborn against the fact that Bitcoin is actually being used A LOT for face to face, point of sale payments, i.e. zero confirmation payments. And again, regardless of any theoretical arguments, IT WORKS. At least until now. What I dont understand is: 1. How the hell was RBF accepted to be integrated into Bitcoin Core? 2. What problem does it solve, or whats the purpose, other than sabotaging point of sale payments which might set back mainstream adoption of Bitcoin a great deal? \n",

      "Firstly, consider The Praying Bankers (Charlie Coopers) [statement here]( > The second thing the fractured regulatory environment does is because it takes longer to get to consensus, to the point made about protecting the dinosaurs, the startups will run out of runway; the companies that will remain standing 5 years from now are the big tech companies or the banks—you know, whomever your villain is—who can wait until this has sorted itself out, and they have plenty of money, and then they decide what they want to do, and the real entrepreneurs, the people now—whether theyre pro-bitcoin-the-currency or not is irrelevant for this conversation—those real entrepreneurs that are out there trying to make a go of it are going to suffer because they dont have enough money to make it 3 years. > And, thats maybe just where we are—maybe a recognition. > But, theres a perception, I think, outside of Washington that regulation itself harms industrial growth, entrepreneurship, etc. Id make the counterargument: Its regulatory uncertainty that causes that harm; if we knew what the regs were, we could operate within them today, and build business models in that context today, but unfortunately because we dont know, and everyone is kind of looking at each other trying to figure it out... I mean, this currency/commodity thing is fascinating; if I have it right—I could be wrong—I think the IRS has already called it a currency, and the CFTC might have called it a commodity... All right... And, its property in Japan—I didnt even know that! So, wow... now what do I do? That seems like a legitimate concern. However, Ill point you to the fact that hes highlighting the problems of a \"fractured\" regulatory situation (something that another guy jokingly calls a \"decentralized\" regulatory framework); indeed, one person laments that the U.S. cannot do what Great Britain does in providing one single regulatory agency to rule them all. There seems to be a push to emphasize the virtues of centralized control; [this guy]( (who is sitting next to The Praying Banker) suggests giving more control over the cryptocurrency industry to the Federal Reserve: > Just to reiterate: We have a fractured regulatory system, but I do think that if the Federal government wanted to go in this direction, there are authorities under the Dodd–Frank act that the FSOC (Financial Stability Oversight Council) could exercise to give the \\[Federal Reserve\\] enhanced authority over this area, and I think its \\[at least worth\\] having the FSOC explore that now—not take a decision on it, necessarily, but have that integrated in the process, so that if they decide in a few years that the Fed is the right place to house an overview of this area and to develop new rules for it, that they could. David Wessel, the moderator, at least sees through it: > Im looking forward to the Industry going to the FSOC and saying \"Please, put us under the umbrella of the Fed—\" Then, some other guy jumps in and helps defend the position, speaking almost in lock-step with the last guy regarding various points, leading the moderator to refer to this outburst as a conspiracy against him. It is a conspiracy, no doubt. The Banks love the Fed, because it is from the Fed that they derive power; so, despite the truth behind Charlies words regarding the harm of regulatory uncertainty, it looks like he and others are merely using that point to maneuver mind-share toward their goal of placing control under one regulatory agency: Their long-time friend and pal, the Federal Reserve. From that cozy situation, R3CEV will be able to set in motion its glorious victory.\n"

      "Here I will summarize the status quo, diagnose the current state of Bitcoin and propose a future roadmap, all in layman terms. Lets first tackle this crisis and move on: We all know that this crash was triggered by Mike Hearn. His childish tantrum-esque departure was given undue amount of attention. A lot of deserved praise has been given to Hearn throughout the years, but at this point he has proven beyond all doubt that his true motivation was wealth and fame. Mike Hearn is a narcissisist who only cares about himself. Lets just review the most important and relevant facts: 1. Mike Hearn has been in disagreement with the development of Bitcoin for quite some time. Some of his concerns have been legit, while others have been fear mongering. He created XT in response where he had dictator power and then whined about people not kneeling before him. 2. When Mike diagnosed Bitcoin with terminal cancer Bitcoin was actually doing good, really good. The Bitcoin price was hovering around ~450. It was seeing more venture capital, more activity and more press than ever. Are there looming concerns in the future? Yes. Are there tons of people working on solutions? Yes. Was, or more importantly is Bitcoin terminally ill? No. 3. This announcement was co-orchestrated with his employer to further their cause. Him and his new employers all got to exit while Bitcoin was doing great. In essence he jumped ship while it was sailing beautifully and then decided to do his best to sink it after reaching safety. Disturbing behaviour. 4. The dishonest and amoral aspect here is the fact that Mike Hearn decided to sacrifice the community whom has built him his fortune. He did not create Bitcoin and the code was open source, his own contributions did not make him rich, rather the believers in Bitcoin made him rich. Code is worth nothing without adoption. He was willing to throw us all under the bus, after pocketing his profit, only to pursue further riches in the banking sector. Its clear that Mike Hearn was never an idealist, he was a disillusioned Google employee who saw an opportunity to be someone in Bitcoin, and when he was no longer influential he wanted it to burn. 5. We should all forget Mike Hearn. Lets name this temporary crash The Hearnia in his disgraced honour and move on. Mike Hearn was not worth 1/5th of Bitcoins market cap or potential. Moving on We have seen all of this before, countless times. This crash is largely a self-fulfilling prophecy. Yet this time everyone reacts as if some fatal flaw was discovered. It wasnt. Does this mean we should ignore the situation? Well, yes. A narcissist left the project, but there is no crisis. The current problems facing Bitcoin have not changed from 2 days ago when everything was going smoothly. No new information has come out that even affect the debate. This is why Bitcoin has been doing great lately, nothing has changed in terms of what Bitcoin is and can become. No venture capital suddenly left, no code was found to be flawed, no big country decided to ban Bitcoin etc. I will not touch on the topic of the block size debate, enough has been written about this for everyone to have made up their own minds. We all know something needs to be done with it. Instead I will shed light on what I perceive to be a much bigger problem with Bitcoin in general: the state of the community. The Bitcoin crowd has evolved from hardcore idealists, activists and enthusiasts into a typical group of investor speculators. The daily price of Bitcoin matter more than any vision, goal or potential. This becomes cringingly obvious whenever other blockchain/crypto projects emerge. Lets get one thing clear: Everyone is allowed to use the concept of the blockchain and expand upon it for non-profit or for-profit projects. The Bitcoin community need to grow up, accept this and stop thinking that there is some sort of patent on the technology. Satoshi created Bitcoin from primarily pre-existing technologies. He was a giant on the shoulders of countless giants. The sheer hypocrisy of bitcoiners attempting to hold the right to the technology and stiffle further innovation is among the most pathetic things imaginable. This leads to the other fact Bitcoiners need to accept: Bitcoin is not a panacea. Numerous specialized solutions will continue to pop up and build on the foundation, or even do everything from scratch in a new way, and we should all be grateful for this. Its this innovation that moves technology and the world forward, stop being greedy and think that everyone that isnt doing everything on Bitcoin is somehow stealing from you. You do not own the idea or potential of this technology. This sort of mentality that is so prevalent in r/bitcoin is cancerous. It is pinning bitcoin up against serious projects that are already seeing serious adoption. Instead of furthering the adoption of Bitcoin this attitude insteads alienate Bitcoin into a category of \"Those nutjobs\". If we want Bitcoin to prosper and be taken seriously we first need to figure out what Bitcoins role should be, then decide how to best mould the code afterwards. Now stop overreacting to this like Mike Hearn wants, stop treating Bitcoin like a private company and move on, there are plenty of important issues to worry about and tackle. This is the roadmap: keep doing what was already being done, nothing changed in the last 2 days.\n",

      "Marshall Long [CTO of FinalHash and CTO of Cryptsy]( who [still lists Cryptsy on the FinalHash website]( has been the one of the primary forces [pushing]( for Bitcoin Classic in what would likely result in a fork with two chains due to its extremely controversial nature of being pushed for activation before SegWit. Since Cryptsys liabilities are primarily in Bitcoin it is theorized he is likely still working closely with them to come up with a way to resolve their problems. Big Verne has [flown to China]( and is likely working closely with Marshall Long in order to create a hard fork where the coins from the losing chain can be dumped on Cryptsys users for pennies on the dollar. The smoking gun here is how he all of a sudden goes from supporting the core roadmap and [saying miners nearly unanimously support segwit]( on Dec 14th to a complete about face and [withdraw of his support from the roadmap on Jan 5th]( do a search for \"FinalHash\" in those archive links to see the specific posts in question. Shortly after this about face it is [revealed]( that Cryptsy was running a fractional reserve. Cryptsy likely knew about [pending legal action]( back in December and would be working on a strategy to resolve their liabilities. Dumping pre-fork coins on their users is a plausible strategy for resolving their legal liabilities. The people involved with Bitcoin Classic have close ties to FinalHash and Cryptsy and have been working under repository called \"Multicoin-co\" [here]( You can see details of the Bitcoin Classic involvement in FinalHash [lead developer]( Ahmed Bodiwalas [github history]( who as you can see [here]( has been very active with altcoin development and also has close ties to Cryptsy in addition to having commit access to the bitcoin classic repository along with jtoomim and Marshall Long himself. Marshall Long was also [closely involved]( with the [mintsy.co scam]( Marshall long has been involved in countless other scams such as GAW miners. While it is just a theory that Marshall Long is pushing for a hard fork to dump the losing chains coins on Cryptsy users it does seem like a realistic possibility given the evidence. Even if there is another reason for this hard fork push do you really want someone involved with all these scams to be in charge of bitcoin protocol development?\n",
      "I’m posting this as an incomplete and rather disorganized draft of an essay I’m working on. Ill will publish a longer and complete post later on (I think Im only about 1/3 of the way through it), but I figured I share what I already have: There’s an ethos to Bitcoin that many people find particularly hard to grasp. In this essay, I’m will attempt to take some of the more technical problems in Bitcoin and distill them into something that can be understood by a wider audience, but first I feel it’s necessary to provide some historical background about the realm of digital/electronic cash. Ill present a few hours of light reading (not required to understand the essay, but important nonetheless):          From the Cypherpunks Manifesto: > We the Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems. We are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic money. This was written in 1993, a full 15 years before Bitcoin was conceived. So why did it take so long? Because there were other electronic money systems that were attempted and failed. In order to understand Bitcoin, I believe its important to understand the context of these past failures. David Chaum came up with a radical idea somewhere around 1982: [“Blind signatures for untraceable payments”]( In the 6 page paper, he laid out an electronic cash system which provided the “inability of third parties to determine the payee, time, or amount of payments made by an individual.” In order to accomplish this, he came up with a beautiful system called a “blind signature.” It was secure, but it had a big non-cryptographic fatal flaw: It required a trusted third party (bank) in order to function. The third party could refuse to make or take payments and do all sorts of other nastiness. That didnt matter to Chaum because his company would be the bank, and he would not violate those ideals. Using these concepts he founded a company called DigiCash (here is the post-mortem): Not to be deterred by prior failure another digital currency company was started around 1998: [E-gold]( This was met with significantly more success in adoption. My theory is that E-Gold succeeded where DigiCash failed because E-gold provided a tangible good (gold) as a backing. It’s hard for a consumer to accept data as money if they have little knowledge of what the past and current money systems are based on. Ultimately, E-gold met a different failure mode: the State (see wiki article for details). I strongly believe that had DigiCash survived to E-gold’s level of adoption, it would have either been co-opted or obliterated by this mechanism as well. There are a number of other examples of failures which have occurred in “E-Cash” world: Beenz, Liberty Reserve, PayPal, etc. There’s a whole other story about PayPal, but for brevity we’ll just say it “co-opted” rather than “obliterated.” These numerous failures were a bit of an ideological crisis for the Cypherpunks. Many were (and many still are) of the opinion that a viable e-cash could not be created without ending in two failure modes: Co-opted (and thus neutered) by existing government/corporate power structures or destroyed because it threatened the aforementioned structures. This is something that’s played out in the physical world as well (see Liberty Dollar). There were a couple good technical reasons why it was thought impossible, not the least of which was the Byzantine General’s Problem (further reading here and here). There were engineered answers to the problem, but none were thought to be resilient enough to withstand an open network with dishonest (and even irrationally evil) participants. Most knew that centralized solutions would fail because they had already been tried (even when created by their own). There were a few solutions that were close to solving the problem but missed the mark (RPOW), were never implemented (bit-gold and b-money), or weren’t intended to be a general solution (hashcash). Enter Bitcoin. On October 31, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto made a post on the Cryptography mail list presenting a copy of his paper: and the abstract. I’ll post the very first public criticism on the list (emphasis mine): > We very, very much need such a system, but the way I understand your proposal, it does not seem to scale to the required size. > For transferable proof of work tokens to have value, they must have monetary value. To have monetary value, they must be transferred within a very large network - for example a file trading network akin to bittorrent. > To detect and reject a double spending event in a timely manner, one must have most past transactions of the coins in the transaction, which, naively implemented, requires each peer to have most past transactions, or most past transactions that occurred recently. If hundreds of millions of people are doing transactions, that is a lot of bandwidth - each must know all, or a substantial part thereof. Reasonably, Satoshi replies with this: > Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node. > The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices. > If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal. I want to point something out about this conversation: Satoshi does not dispute James Donald’s point that a fully deployed network at the time of publication would not be possible… he simply states that in the future it will be possible because of optimizations and technological improvements. I believe that neither are right, but Satoshi was just slightly closer to being correct. Close enough to pique the Hal Finneys (creator of RPOW) interest and the rest is history. Some other notes that I’ll be working on incorporating into a final draft of this: Based on email provided by Wei Dai to gwern, Satoshi was known to contact Adam Back and Wei Dai before the posting on p2pfoundation or on the Cryptography mailing list. It’s interesting the lack of knowledge that Satoshi displayed regarding prior art: it seems he didn’t know about b-money, RPOW, or bitgold at the time he was directed by Adam towards the b-money concept. It makes me wonder if he would have fallen into a mental trap had he known about those concepts.\n",
      "Hey guys, Im still a newb in regards to Bitcoin. I use bitcoin for sports bet via nitrogen. I have been buying btc from Circle because its instant and I can transfer the funds to my bank. Ive heard that if they find out if they know youre using Nitrogen they will keep your money.

      "So RBF seems to be a good idea to me, who wants their transaction stuck forever? However, for me and others the main beef with RBF is that it takes an original transaction and completely replaces it; inputs, outputs, and amounts. Why dont we have a RBF that literally replaces the fee? This way there is no way the transaction can be undone, only pushed through. This way 0-conf can still be used to some degree. Maybe Im missing something?\n",
      "It seems the R3CEV plan is going right as expected, they crush the price, and now they offer Classic as a cop out for all the uninformed newbies (majority) and bro-coders that want a block size increase, whatever increase at this point, they just want to see something bigger than 1MB just for the sake of it, without looking at the details. Bigger is better, lower fees are better, easy to cater for the masses, which dont grasp the consequences. \"Lets have a shop with free meals forever and pretend its sustainable without any tradeoffs!\". They just dont get Bitcoin is supposed to emulate Tor, not Paypal. The Paypal part is done through a layer, so if it layer (LN) fcks up someday, we still have the super decentralized core where 1 person can still be 1 node, so Blythe Masters and their friends cant coerce it and bribe the datacenter-running nodes into doing whatever its on their agendas. We are going towards a cashless society, and their nightmare is that a decentralized alternative to move money exists. The further we go from the 1 person = 1 node scheme, the nearer they are from reaching their goal. This is something casuals tend not to understand, for some reason. I guess they cant cope with the fact Bitcoin cant scale globally without an additional layer (LN), so they think \"well fck it, I want my coffee in the blockchain without fees, I dont care about the consequences, its all FUD!!\" Anyway, as we know, SegWit would be enough to keep progressing without the necessity of the absurd risk of raising the block size which requires a hardfork (inb4 Erik Voorhees lecturing us into how its better to hard fork even if its riskier because \"SegWit is too complex\" -this is exactly how a bro-coder looks like), until we have LN and sidechains deployed, which is what they absolutely FEAR the most, since when this happens, its pretty much game over for them, thats why they are pulling desperate moves such as the Mike Hearns ragequit on one of the biggest newspapers in the world (not before he and his friends sold their coins), then right on time, they offer Classic as a savior, its XTrojan horse all over again, but more subtle. Heres my question: Theres not even code released for Classic yet, but its clear they are going to copy-paste Core and raise the block size while claiming they are better. As we also know, the raw talent is all on Cores dev team, as demonstrated by 7+ years and endless BIPs. How are they going to keep copy-pasting further updates if Core devs give up at some point? We would have a bunch of amateurs trying to run Bitcoin by themselves, since I assume most Core devs would give up on the idea of an increasingly node-centralized Bitcoin which is the ultimate goal of those that are trying to derail Cores roadmap. There would be no more Peter Wuilles and Greg Maxwells doing miracles to keep nodes decentralized while increasing privacy. It would be as if Litecoin didnt had Bitcoin to copy-paste from. Lets just hope the disaster doesnt happen but if it happens, I wonder how the Core dev team will deal with. I just cant imagine how frustrating it is to spend so much time on this, to get some idiots copy-pasting your stuff and changing a node-centralizing variable and then call it a better software, then keep developing Core as they routinely copy-paste every update you release on their agenda-driven fork. Can you fking believe it? I just cant stand how obvious the fact that this is just a power grab backed by developers and companies from Blockchain Alliance trying to decrease the influence of cypherpunks. This is the biggest cold-war ever, and you dont even know it. \n",
      "From his [\"The resolution of the Bitcoin experiment\" post]( \"The reason the true limit seems to be 700 kilobytes instead of the theoretical 1000 is that sometimes miners produce blocks smaller than allowed and even empty blocks, despite that there are lots of transactions waiting to confirm — this seems to be most frequently caused by interference from the Chinese “Great Firewall” censorship system. More on that in a second.\" \"Because the block chain is controlled by Chinese miners, just two of whom control more than 50% of the hash power. At a recent conference over 95% of hashing power was controlled by a handful of guys sitting on a single stage. The miners are not allowing the block chain to grow.\" \"And the final reason is that the Chinese internet is so broken by their government’s firewall that moving data across the border barely works at all, with speeds routinely worse than what mobile phones provide.\" \"Right now, the Chinese miners are able to — just about — maintain their connection to the global internet\" So, established by Mike: Chinese miners are currently the largest players, at least 50% of the mining power and they have limited bandwidth which is barely able to operate at current capacity. What is his solution?: \"In August 2015 it became clear that due to severe mismanagement, the “Bitcoin Core” project that maintains the program that runs the peer-to-peer network wasn’t going to release a version that raised the block size limit. The reasons for this are complicated and discussed below. But obviously, the community needed the ability to keep adding new users. So some long-term developers (including me) got together and developed the necessary code to raise the limit. That code was called BIP 101 and we released it in a modified version of the software that we branded Bitcoin XT.\" [BIP101]( \"The maximum size shall be 8,000,000 bytes at a timestamp of 2016-01-11 00:00:00 UTC\" So his solution, increase capacity to 8MB 6 days ago. So what are we to assume would have happened then? I dont claim to be smart enough to accurately predict the result but Im pretty sure based on the assumptions Mike laid out in his own words this would impact most of bitcoins mining capacity. Does this seem like a prudent plan to you? I found a ton of other amazing misrepresentations, like this one: [\"it’s now common to be asked to pay more to miners than a credit card would charge\"]( Common? Really? Perhaps if one is spending 1 BTC of collected dust, but that doesnt not seem like a common scenario. There are plenty more misrepresentations but Im trying to stay focused on the bandwidth issue, though this is the kicker to me: \"When parts of the community are viciously turning on the people that have introduced millions of users to the currency, you know things have got really crazy.\" Isnt that just exactly what Mike Hearn did with this medium post? Not only did he turn on the people who managed to bootstrap, maintain and nurture this system, he turned on all of the XT supporters and all investors. Also notice the failure to mention hes now an R3 employee working on a competing blockchain? Perhaps if he really cared about the people he worked with and the community he represented, that he claims he was trying to help with XT, in the interest of fairness and knowing the broader public eye would be on this post due to the NYT article, he would have disclosed that. He should have. IMO, all indicators are that this was simply a bitcoin hit piece in an attempt to benefit his personal stock and new employer. So to my point, if 1 of the 2 leaders of the XT movement would do such a thing and was so influential as to precipitate this major rift, should we perhaps use more caution before trusting successors with easy solutions? I hope this post serves to reopen the questions regarding bandwidth which seem to not be adequately discussed (thanks /u/Mike_Hearn for providing the valuable information), and to hopefully restore some faith in the more mature and cautious development and process of the core developers vs. the reactive and emotional responses of their detractors. Note, I believe what Theymos did with censorship was wrong and completely antithetical to the spirit of bitcoin, but we need to be collectively cautious rather than assume the logical response is to blindly follow a different path and a new charismatic leader. Especially when that path seems to be clearly dangerous based on the prior leaders own words. \n",

      "For clarification purposes, Im not a computer scientist. Im quite well informed on Bitcoin and economics and I am a bitcoin holder. And I run a proper node (well non mining..). Good Bitcoiner here :) I still dont know which side of the block size is right. I assume good faith from both sides and to me the ad-hominem attacks and accusation of nefarious intents are silly (Except in the case of Mike Hearn who ironically championed these dirty tactics) I think its a good thing he is gone, because too divisive, too statist, didnt see anything wrong with centralisation, blacklisting etc.. Jeff and Gavin on the other hand I have no doubt have a lot of skin in the game and hold very dear the ideals of Bitcoin: freedom. And both of them pay attention not only to the technical side but also to the economics of Bitcoin. Now I have to say that if forced to choose, my logic would I guess be to stick with core developpers. Bitcoin is far from its final form and they are the one getting us there. They have delivered in the last few years, and are also building a lot of the innovations most of us are looking forward to. So the the technical side of it seems to be in their favor. BUT I have discussed this issue multiple times with friends (including computer engineers) and most of us still dont get what is the REAL problem with reasonably bigger blocks. I think one big issue is that some people who were arguing for 1mb in the past came up with the node count as a reason to not increase the blocksize. The number of bitcoin nodes hasnt fallen from 10K+ to 5k because its costly to run a node at 1mb. It is very cheap to run a node for the majority of the users. Marginal cost almost 0. More or less the same for 4mb. The reason people are not running nodes is because they dont care. Its the same thing as GHASH, people will run nodes when they feel we are REALLY too low. They will only care if they see an imminent danger/warning. Its a little bit of hassle to run a node: human being are extremely lazy, just forwarding a port for example or letting your computer run 24/24 is a roadblock. The hassle again is more or less the same at 1mb or 4mb. At way higher size, you could have a node on a barebone for a few hundred bucks. This is nothing, we have thousands of people holding 5-8 figures in $ of bitcoin. They could spend much more than that on running a node if they had to. So I think this argument is counterproductive because easily dismissed. Everytime I hear it, I feel like if its all that you have, then lets do it. But I suspect there are much stronger arguments to be made, so I would like to hear about them. Thats why Im posting here. So can you explain in laymans terms why exactly 4mb (2m+seg wit) blocks pose any serious problem ?Whats the treshold and why? I mean Adam Back was proposing 8mb (So 4mb with seg witness) only a few months ago. And If 4mb is fine then, why not do it ? I understand this is part a political decision, people (business, bitcoin holders) are worried about Bitcoins adoption and future viability. Maybe they should just wait patiently.. But on the other hand if 4mb is not a technical problem then why not accomodate them ? Its not like we are anywhere near mainstream adoption, its not impacting a fundamental characteristic of Bitcoin either (decentralisation, scarcity, fungibility -which is still lacking a bit-). If you think its impacting decentralisation, then can you please lay out clear arguments once again? ---- TLDR: not decided on which side is right, support bitcoin core, trust Gavin and Jeff too, dont think node count is a valid argument, ask whats the real technical problem and the treshold with 4mb or more. ---- Edit: - Some answers on this page: but doesnt provide very strong arguments against 2mb in my opinion. \"We dont have the experience\" => Now might be a goodtime to experience it. \"Upgrades Required\" => Doesnt seem like a major reason not do it. \"Other changes required\"=> Lets see what Bitcoin Classic proposes on these ? - Another interesting post here: - On the Bitcoin core Slack, somebody told me for him the problem is the Hard fork not the size increase. For him a Hard fork without strong consensus constitutes a breach of the social contract. But there was no strong technical arguments presentented. However I dont think any core dev were presents to answer.\n",

      "Mike Hearns door-slamming departure was a sell signal to weaker hands but it hasnt much rustled my jimmies. Mike is yesterdays news. Those whove experienced a messy breakup will recognise Mikes role as the spurned lover. Sadly, at some point Mike became a primadonna who threw tantrums when his ~~shitty~~ ideas were snubbed. Mike soon became more trouble than he was worth. After being ostracized by active, sensible developers, Mike made an embarrasing public scene with his XT nonsense. After that failed, Mike leapt into the arms of a decrepit banking sugardaddy, all while spouting histrionic venom about his former dalliance. Mike has rendered himself untrustworthy and irrelevant through such bitchy, gold-digging behaviour. Good riddance, I say, and cheap at the price. More concerning than Mikes antics is this sneaky hardfork push by \"Classic.\" Mikes populist campaign to drum up support by XT by harping on blocksize opened up a festering wound in Bitcoins consensus, a vulnerability Classic now seeks to exploit. While the rest of us were enjoying the holidays, these Toomin nobodies, buffered by manufactured social-media hype, were sneaking about China, busily deceiving miners. Classic now presents the support of these duped miners for 2 Mb. blocks as a fait accompli which will soon put them in control of Bitcoins future. These untested manipulators, who sprang from nowhere with their tweaked code, believe they have what it takes to steer Bitcoins development? Really? Fuck that and fuck them. How could anyone trust these guys? Are these Chinese miners whove pledged their support COMPLETE AND UTTER FOOLS? Dont they realise a contentious hardfork will wreck Bitcoins value and destroy their business? If long-term holders dump their holdings in disgust at this reckless coup, will those miners be able to keep their lights on? And what about insane early adopters whove [vowed economic war] ( on any forked chain? Do these gullible miners imagine that ongoing DDoS, double-spending attacks (and possible assassinations) are going to be a PR picnic which pumps Bitcoins price? Talk about killing the goose which lays the golden egg. The value destruction threatens to be immense. Promising companies will die in droves and mining ops will go bust. All those whove invested time, money and effort into the Bitcoin project may be left with a broken shitcoin run by opportunistic non-entities. And all because a bunch of impatient idiots thought convenient coffee-payments were the worlds burning issue and couldnt wait a few more months for their BTC frappucinos. In the midst of all this suicidal stupidity, banking vultures circle with their total-surveillance Bankcoin waiting in the wings and Ethereum spammers crawl all over r/Bitcoins face like maggots. Im not sure how a community of supposely rational, self-interested actors allowed things to reach this point. But theres still time to pull back from the brink... All the bullshit of the blocksize wedge-issue aside, I urge everyone to judge the Core and Classic development teams with the [wisdom of Solomon:]( One team is willing to divide Bitcoin with a contentious hardfork. The other team is doing everything humanly possible to resist a hardfork, whether by XT or Classic. Further, the Core team recognises the scalability issue and has committed to a [relatively safe plan.] ( This plan will both preserve Bitcoins value and allow it to grow. But of course, such a sensible solution doesnt put the Classic \"devs\" in charge, so they and their minions reject it on a variety of pretexts. Theyd rather split the baby. Who do you think has the best interests of Bitcoin at heart? Whatever your position on blocksize, contrasting the approach of these two teams should signal which is the caring parent and which is the envious pretender, hellbent on either controlling or destroying Bitcoin.\n",

      "Mike Hearns recent bitcoin criticism makes very valid points in terms of scalability and monopoly. However, Id like to urge people to not jump to conclusions, and point out that Mike is loudly expressing his opinionated point of view. We should take his criticism seriously and work on improving the scalability and democratic governance of bitcoin - whether on the main or on the XT fork, depending on how core will now behave. Even if bitcoins price drops as predicted by Mike (which is largely a self-fulfilling prophecy, as he was a core developer - but I think well soon see a recover), this doesnt negate all the work weve been doing on blockchain technologies which construct consensus mechanisms upon which the redecentralized future of the Internet will be built. Several of Mikes concerns are actually addressed in newer cryptocurrencies. Decred has better bottom-up governance. His own XT has larger block size limits. Bitcoin itself is talking extensively about scalability, not just increasing the block size limit but also more fundamental and difficult, yet less politically charged, changes. Litecoin, monero, and ethereum all employ egalitarian proof of work, making Chinese or other monopolies quite harder to achieve. Bitcoin is a large experiment, and even if bitcoin itself as a currency fails, others will take its place. However, lets not rush to conclusions and lets remember that bitcoin has showed surprising resilience to problems, from long blockchain forks and core bugs to the mtgox case. Its indisputable that blockchains will be the new primitives of cryptographic and security functions. Upon them we can base political change for a more democratized monetary, legal, and governance system. The research and teaching weve been doing, the software weve been writing, the papers weve been reading all provide useful contributions whatever cryptocurrency may dominate. Furthermore, dont forget the quote from the monero paper illustrating how a healthy market of multiple competing currencies is best for all; we dont need a single prevailing currency, and fragmentation must not be feared. When I met Mike in Zürich, he had just left Google and I had just started working there. Luck has it that I sat at the same desk where he used to sit. Mike left Google to build blockchain technologies, and a year later I left too, with the same goal. I appreciate Mikes involvement in lighthouse, XT, scalability, bitcoinj and the Android wallet. His involvement in the bitcoin community was huge and I think we should all appreciate what he did without dismissing his work as many tend to do now that hes distancing himself from the project. Despite the fun googler bitcoin meetups weve had with Mike in Zürich, I want to make sure everyone is aware of his current involvement with 30 large centralized banks including ING, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and JP Morgan through his key professional position at R3. It is clear that there is conflict of interest between his blockchain work with these banks, where decentralization is undesired, and the democratized blockchain for the people in modern cryptocurrencies. His blogs and publications must be read critically and keeping this in mind, even if he denies conflict of interest. Scientific and engineering criticism must be done based on science and code, not on people credentials. The things hes pointing out on his blog are not new and they are issues to be resolved. His status as a past core developer is irrelevant in assessing the validity of his statements. Bitcoin is never short of drama and politics. But the real technical issues must be addressed technically at their core. Mike - thank you for your work on bitcoin. You are greatly appreciated. The community will now take over. \n",

They too now understand that Bitcoin is not yet ready for large blocks. Partially thanks to the Great Firewall of China. So their proposal is currently 2MB and chance has it that Core already had an increase of that order of magnitude in its road map and has already implemented and tested the feature. 1.75MB using SegWit is not only a block size limit increase, it opens up many other future scaling avenues. Consensus near? Wel, the upgrade method by \"Classic\" is incompatible with the method that Core uses. Or to be more precies with Bitcoin as a whole. So they cant go simultaneously. All that needs to happen now is for \"Classic\" to revert their threats for a hard fork by March 1st. If they do that, everyone can sit back and relax (well except the Core devs) for about a month longer and everything will be fine and war would be averted.

      "Ive been trying to wrap my head around the mechanics of Opt-In RBF, and I think Ive reached the conclusion that its just been explained all wrong. The way things currently work (without Opt-In RBF), you send a transaction, the miners collect it, and theyll presumably add it to the block theyre mining. If the block is full, theyll prioritize the highest-fee transactions. If your transaction doesnt make the cut, itll have to wait until the next block. If blocks continue to be full, your transaction might continue to not make the cut, and it could end up in limbo this way. Miners currently (presumably) follow a First Seen Safe policy, which means if they see another transaction trying to send the same coins, theyre going to prioritize whichever transaction they saw first. However, this is completely up to the miners discretion. There is no way for anyone else to figure out whether a particular transaction was replaced. So, if a miner sees two transactions attempting to send the same coins, but one has a higher fee, the miner has the incentive and ability to replace the lower-fee transaction with the higher-fee one in order to collect the higher fee, and theres nothing stopping them from doing that. Thats the status quo. Full RBF already exists, if miners decide to use it. The software doesnt do that off-the-shelf, but any miner could modify their software to do this, and the protocol does nothing to stop it, as far as I understand. So, what does \"Opt-In RBF\" change? Well, it gives you a way to tell the miners if you want them to do RBF or not. In terms of enforceability, its just a suggestion. Like the pointless \"Do Not Track\" feature browsers have, it just tells the miner what your preference is. It isnt really opt-in RBF, its opt-out RBF, with RBF having effectively been the default all along. And, unless theres something Im not understanding (which is very possible), miners can continue to do full RBF whether you opt in or not, or regardless of whether youre using a client that \"supports\" Opt-In RBF. If Ive misunderstood something, please correct me.\n",
      "So what are the advantages of having seg-wit as a soft fork? With my current understanding nodes/miners who have not upgraded will see transactions as spendable by everyone if implemented as soft-fork. This means that miners on older versions will accept any transactions spending seg-wit outputs, transactions considered invalid by the new clients so old version miners will lose money by orphaned blocks in the best case. In the worst case old version miners will have the longest chain and people lose seg-wit money. Effectively any invalid transaction considered valid by old clients will cause a hard fork.

      "As many of you probably know, Greece is suffering from a terrible debt crisis. Part of what gave rise to this situation is the massive tax evasion that goes on in Greece, where Greek politicians compare tax evasion to that of a \"sport\". Lets say Greece decides to switch to its local Drachma, and because of the devaluation of the Drachma it is able to actually make a dent into its loans. Subsequently, because of the devaluation, Greece will become the cheapest place in Europe to vacation (and become even more of a hotspot globally, especially with fears of terrorism occurring in traditional tourism hotspots like Turkey, Egypt, etc.) and purchase goods. Private citizens will trade in their Euro-denominated assets for drachma or other. During this usage of the Drachma, the Greek government will develop an analogue to the Bitcoin and release it to public eventually where it would not be too much of a shock to the economy. It would be akin to the DOD development of the internet and the internets release to the public. Because of the transparent nature of Bitcoin-technology, it will be easy to tax (as it will be the legal tender of the Hellenic Republic), it will avoid the problem of corrupt banks, and so forth. Additionally, it will be a stable currency due to the finite supply and promote a strong economy.

      "I am sending you this message because the crypto community is too heavily censored, please read carefully. The original of idea bitcoin is to create a decentralized money system that prevents censorship and being shutdown. Proof of work seemed like a good way to achieve that. The real power in the bitcoin world is helt by the miners, as long as the mining process is properly decentralized bitcoin will be decentralized. But real world competition caused many cracks to appear in this model, the first flaws that appeared were pooled mining (centralizing power with mining operators), then came ASICs (Centralizing power with mining operators with good industry connections), then came cheap electricity + latency issues (Centralizing power with mining pools with access to cheap electicity and low latency to others big mining pools). These pressures has essentially caused mining to be centalized mainly in China because there they have cheap electricity, good industry for creating ASICs and low latency to other chinese mining pools (and high latency to the rest of the world). One important thing to keep in mind is that bitcoin itself can evade capital controls and move seamlessly accross borders. But mining equipment cannot. It would be easy to confiscate all mining equipment in the country and use it to destroy bitcoin. So what is the solution to this problem? Proof of stake is the solution because it removed the physical element and allows network voting power to move seamlessly accross borders too. Traditional Proof of Stake contains some flaws like the Nothing at Stake problem. But the new algorithm designed for proof of stake in Ethereum solved all these issues. The bitcoin developer community has proven that it is unable to make even small changed to the consesus algorithm. So completely switching to a different model is never going to happen. If you are willing to open your mind and learn about how Ethereum will beat bitcoin by being far superior to bitcoin watch the videos of Devcon1 Bitcoin is doomed and Ethereum will replace it. EDIT: It happened again.\n",
      "Perfect is the enemy of good, so its time to reevaluate the risks -- both new and old -- and act accordingly. A 2MB hard fork + SegWit, each with appropriate throttles, is a fantastic solution for the short term while we all spend another two years planning a second hard fork to install a more permanent dynamic cap solution within the bounds of network and system limitations. With SegWit, you can control its multiplying effect using a linear discount increase. With the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE variable, you can do the same using linear growth every X blocks until you reach 2MB (or something similar) Combined, you could very easily control the growth rate for two years while you work on all of the other projects and upgrades you have in the pipeline. I, for one, believe theres still time for a compromise, and Id love to keep the geniuses at Core on the job -- in addition to Classic! Its time to understand our new circumstances, reevaluate whats best for everyone, and move forward accordingly. Most importantly, its time to work together. Please take the time to seriously consider this proposal and communicate your responses effectively and politely.\n",
      "I understand that because miners continuously become more efficient, the network hashing power should increase despite a lesser incentive to mine. But shouldnt the concern really be how much money is invested into securing the network, rather than how powerful the network is? Its already the case that large mining farms can boast better efficiency and larger returns than smaller operations. All that is stopping centralization at the moment is the incredibly large (and risky) investment it would take to control the majority of the network. With a smaller block reward, isnt the total worth of the network becoming lesser, and such an investment becoming more feasible? I also understand that the value of bitcoin is (or at least should be) expected to increase over time, but I dont personally see this as a viable solution. Bitcoin hasnt exactly had a track record of STEADY growth. Couldnt an unexpected downturn of $/BTC leave the network vulnerable?\n",

      "This way we would have the 2mb hardfork that classic is pushing for and all the nice features that segwit introduces. They are not mutually exclusive. If you think that both activated lead to a capacity of 4mb and if you think this is too big, you could cap it like this: `segwit data + blocksize data <= 2mb AND blocksize data <= 2mb`. Priority could be given to segwit transactions. /u/maaku7 /u/pwuille /u/nullc It would be a shame if the community split because Cores unwillingness to compromise. Segwit and a hardfork need not be mutually exclusive. Pulling of a hardfork successfully is not that hard or risky if we wait for 95% of the hashing power to get behind it and put in grace period for even the laziest of nodes to upgrade. It would send a strong signal that the community is able to reach consensus and move forward.\n",

      "Once again my attempt to summarize and explain the weekly bitcoin developer meeting in laymans terms. [Link to last summarisation]( Disclaimer Please bear in mind Im not a developer so some things might be incorrect or plain wrong. There are no decisions being made in these meetings, but since a fair amount of devs are present its a good representation. Copyright: Public domain  Logs - [link to this week logs]( - [Meeting minutes by meetbot](  Main topics - Versionbits - Status of segregated witness - Status of 0.12 bitcoin-core release - Consensus code encapsulation (libconsensus) - Locktime PRs  Versionbits  background [BIP 9]( Currently softforks have been done by the isSuperMajority mechanism, meaning when 95% of the last 1000 blocks have a version number higher than X the fork is deployed. A new way of doing this is currently being worked on and that uses all bits of the version number, appropriately being called versionbits. So instead of a fork happening when the version is larger than (for example) 00000000011 (3), a fork happens when (for example) the 3rd bit is up (so 00100000011). This way softforks can be deployed simultaneous and independent of each other.  meeting comments Morcos is volunteering to take over championing this proposal as CodeShark and Rusty are busy on other things. Hell review both implementations and then decide on which implementation hell base his work upon. He notes that if non-core implementations are trying to do something else (and are using nVersion for their signaling) while segregated witness is being deployed, not conflicting will be important so users of other versions can also support segregated witness. If theres an agreement with this approach its necessary that versionbits is ready before the segregated witness deployment. jtimon has some suggestions to make the implementation less complicated and more flexible.  meeting conclusion Morcos will champion the new reference implementation for [BIP9: Versionbits](  Status of segregated witness  background Segregated witness changes the structure of transactions so that the signatures can be separated from the rest of the transactions. This allows for bandwidth savings for relay, pruning of old signatures, softforking all future script changes by introducing script versions and solves all unintentional forms of malleability. During the last scaling bitcoin conference Pieter Wuille presented a way of doing this via a softfork, and proposed increasing the maximum amount of transactions in a block by discounting signature data towards the total blocksize. Segregated witness is part of the [capacity increase roadmap]( for bitcoin-core. More detailed explanations: - [By Pieter Wuille at the San Francisco bitcoin developer meetup]( (more technical) - [By Andreas Antonopoulos in the lets talk bitcoin podcast]( (less technical)  meeting comments Segnet, the testnet for segregated transactions, will be going to its 3rd version soon. Luke-Jr has assigned all the segregated witness BIPs to a 14x range. Currently there are 4 BIPs: [141]( [142]( [143]( and [144](  Status of 0.12 bitcoin-core release  background Bitcoin Core 0.12 is scheduled for release around February and introduces a lot of fixes and improvements. ([release notes]( Theres a release candidate 0.12rc1 available at  meeting comments Luke-Jr feels PRs [7149]( [7339]( and [7340]( should have been in 0.12, but are now really late and possibly impractical to get in. For gitian builders: 0.12rc1s osx sig attach descriptor fails due to a missing package (thats not actually needed). Rather than using the in-tree descriptor, use the one from [7342]( This is fixed for rc2. \"fundrawtransaction\" and \"setban\" should be added to the release notes. At some point it makes more sense to document these commands elsewhere and link to it in the release notes, as theyve become very lengthy. Wumpus thinks the release notes have too much details, theyre not meant to be a substitute for documentation.  meeting conclusion Close PR [7142]( as its now part of [7148]( Everyone is free to improve on the release notes, just submit a PR.  consensus code encapsulation (libconsensus)  background Satoshi wasnt the best programmer out there, which leaves a pretty messy code. Ideally youd have the part of the code that influences the network consensus separate, but in bitcoin its all intertwined. Libconsensus is what eventually should become this part. This way people can more easily make changes in the non-consensus part without fear of causing a network fork. This however is a slow and dangerous project of moving lots of code around.  meeting comments jtimon has 4 libconsensus related PRs open, namely [7091]( [7287]( [7311]( and [7310]( He thinks any \"big picture branch\" will be highly unreadable without merging something like 7310 first. The longest \"big picture branch\" he currently has is Hell document the plan and \"big picture\" in stages: 1. have something to call libconsensus: expose verifyScript. (Done) 2. put the rest of the consensus critical code, excluding storage in the same building package (see 7091) 3. discuss a complete C API for libconsensus 4. separate it into a sub-repository Wumpus notes hed like to start with 3 as soon as possible as an API would be good to guide this.  meeting conclusion review [7091]( [7287]( [7311]( and [7310](  Locktime PRs  background [BIP 68]( Consensus-enforced transaction replacement signaled via sequence numbers. [BIP 112]( CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY. [BIP 113]( Median time-past as endpoint for lock-time calculations. In short: BIP 68 changes the meaning of the sequence number field to a relative locktime. BIP 112 makes that field accessible to the bitcoin scripting system. BIP 113 enables the usage of GetMedianTimePast (the median of the previous 11 blocks) from the prior block in lock-time transactions.  meeting comments We need to make a choice between 2 implementations, namely [6312]( and [7184]( PR 7184 is a result of the CreateNewBlock optimisations not being compatible with 6312. jtimon thinks it could be merged relatively soon as 7184 is based on 6312 which has plenty of testing and review.  meeting conclusion Close [6312]( in favor of [7184]( Morcos will fix the open nits on 7184 btcdrak will update the BIP-text  Participants wumpus Wladimir J. van der Laan btcdrak btcdrak morcos Alex Morcos jtimon Jorge Timón Luke-Jr Luke Dashjr MarcoFalke Marco Falke jonasshnelli Jonas Schnelli cfields Cory Fields sipa Pieter Wuille kanzure Bryan Bishop droark Douglas Roark sdaftuar Suhas Daftuar Diablo-D3 Patrick McFarland  Comic relief 19:54 wumpus meetingstop 19:54 wumpus stopmeeting 19:54 btcdrak haha 19:54 MarcoFalke closemeeting 19:54 wumpus endmeeting 19:54 lightningbot` Meeting ended Thu Jan 14 19:54:26 2016 UTC.

      "Posted this on the forum (btalk) yesterday but not many responses, so reposting here for smarter-than-me to review and comment: Reading the release notes for 0.12 RC I was wondering of a possible attack vector introduced there so would like to check the scenario here before doing further review of the code (yeap - sometimes asking saves a lot of time) and testing it out. - PR 6722 adds an automatic update of the min relay fee when mempool is full - New version enables RBF Possible scenario: 1. Flood the network with a chained TXs with high fee to use most of the standard mempool size space, bump out others txs and set a high minimum fee 2. Change through RBF the first TX with a higher fee to invalidate the entire chain 3. Long time for the entire blockchain to recover and possible disruption of services that dont rebroadcast their txs - Cost of running the attack would be VERY low if RBF invalidates the entire chain before its added to a block. - Making a chain of very large transactions (multiples txins and txouts) would allow for quickly fill up mempool with lower risk of propagation delay of the RBF transaction. - Max. allowed unconfirmed chain is 25tx or 100Kb. So considering that max mempool default is 300MB, youd need 3000 chains to clog the mempool. To bump the minimum fee 10x from 1000 satoshi/kb to 10000 satoshi/kb would only cost 0.3BTC. Ways to avoid the impact: - RBF can only be issued if it changes entire tx chain - RBF recalculates min relay fee based on mempool size (anticipates the half life of fee decay) Is this scenario a possible attack vector?

      "With the planned changes being pushed by core, merchants who take payments through BitPay and CoinBase are now going to have a more difficult time dealing with double spends. I would propose to both BitPay and CoinBase to implement a service that holds bitcoins that are time locked on the block chain with multi-signature, where BitPay or CoinBase is one of the required signatories to release the coins. Customers would send coins to addresses where BitPay or CoinBase are the required signers to release coins, and when the coins are to be released BitPay or CoinBase would sign the transaction once and only once. This would ensure that merchants taking transactions with zero-conf can trust that a customer cannot try to spend again because BitPay and CoinBase would refuse to sign another transaction from the same address. To make this system trustless, the address in question would have a time lock of a day or two. After the time lock expires, only the owner of the coins would be able to spend the coins while the second BitPay or CoinBase signature would no longer be required. Thus, if CoinBase or BitPay cannot or will not sign a transaction to release the coins, at worst, a customer can recover his coins when the time lock expires. Pros:  Customers can use this service without trusting CoinBase or BitPay.  Merchants can trust coins signed by CoinBase or BitPay with zero-confirmations. Cons:  Customers would have to pre-lock their coins to use this service.  Merchants would need to be warned if the coins are not coming from these trusted multi-signature addresses and that 0-confirmation is no longer (relatively) safe because of RBF changes.  May require changes to core so that one signatory of a multi signature address expires after one or two days.  Requires changes to CoinBase and BitPay software and merchant interface.\n",

ALT coins do just that for the cyrpto universe but why cant BC do it internally and be a set of block chains instead of 1? Now you could even Reduce block size! combine that with segwit ideology of moving superfluous outside the chain BC comfirm times would be slashed.

So, simply put: if I have a txid, how do I find out if this txid can be reverted or replaced due to the new opt-in RBF feature?

      "Hi all. Im taking the liberty to share some hard-won experience at this point in time.  Some advice for Core and supporters Its easy to feel resentment at this stage, having done so much work and written so much high-quality code, and yet getting a shitstorm for it. When I was leading the Swedish Pirate Party into the European Parliament, I was gradually getting used to getting a barrage of criticism grenades for everything I did and didnt do every single day, starting with when I did or didnt get out of bed in the morning. Its very hard to explain what this does to your psyche to somebody who hasnt experienced it. Imagine everybody was out to get you, every single day, and giving you high-pitched screaming blame for everything from an orange being round to some Mongolian guys utter misinterpretation of what you said three years ago. Im not exaggerating when I say that people could probably snap and go restraining-shirt-insane for much less. But the crucial thing when youre in a leadership position like that, getting criticism for absolutely everything, is to maintain your ability to sort the relevant criticism apart from the back seat drivers who make a living out of complaining but not contributing. Youve also got to trust your inner compass of the vision you want to accomplish. From what I can tell, Core has made the common but crucial mistake of isolating itself from the community and taking on an expert attitude toward everybody else in trusting this inner vision compass over external criticism, where Core is somehow right by definition - the development happens as Core wants it, period. This is very dangerous in any open-source / free software project. Other people are just as intelligent and may have considerable experience and ability to evaluate the claims made, and these should - no, must - be taken seriously. To illustrate just one point, lets take a look at Cores scaling solution here, Segregated Witness. When I apply my nontrivial experience in coding and systems design - I started coding 37 years ago - I see these two options for scaling bitcoin near-term: OPTION ONE - Change the blocksize upper limit to two megabytes. One line of code for the constant, about ten LOCs for activation trigger logic. Requires upgrading of a majority server software. OPTION TWO - Introduce Segwit. About 500 lines of new code, of which at least 100 in the hypersensitive consensus code. Requires upgrading a majority of server software _and all client/wallet software and client/wallet hardware, especially those needing to pay money to an arbitrary address_ (as Segwit introduces a new type of address). When proponents of Cores scaling tell me that Option Two here is the better _because its safer_, and I try to comprehend that statement, I am either utterly insane or the statement is the equivalent of \"black is white and up is down\". Its just not completely counter to all experience in software engineering risk management, its so far out it doesnt reflect sunlight anymore. When I try to understand more and challenge the assertion that option two is _safer_ - on what I must say are very good grounds - Im told that I should be leaving design to the experts and that I dont understand enough of the complex machine that is bitcoin. I know I am capable of learning complexities, but I am firmly told off from even trying. Thats just not how you succeed in maintaining a community. Thats not how you make people want to run your code. Of course, people are free to run whatever code they like. But the checks and balances in an open source community is simple: if the leadership for a project builds something different from what people want to run, they will run something else. Its therefore in the interest of the leadership to listen to the community to understand what software a majority wants to run. These competing interests provide the checks and balances. Now, I understand the complexity of block transfer times through the Chinese firewall and that preliminary tests indicate that a typical full node is saturated at a blocksize of 32 megabytes. However, none of these limits will be hit by this particular scaling. Also, when blazing a trail like this, you work one problem at a time, you solve one bottleneck at a time. People have been flagging for the necessity of increasing the blocksize for ... I dont have dates here at hand, but it should be the better part of a year if not more. Further down the road, scaling node throughput capacity can be done in a number of ways from GPUing ECDSA to specialized hardware, but its not the imminent bottleneck. When such an enormous amount of crucial data (on the need to raise the blocksize limit) is ignored, that is done at the peril of the project. People in the bitcoin community are intelligent geeks, capable of inhaling absurd amounts of information and cross-referencing all of it. If you are unable to explain why your solution is better than another proposed solution, people will be utterly dissatisfied with the response \"because we are the experts\" - for you must assume that other people in the community, in the general case, are at least as intelligent and capable of learning as you are. Its even possible that if you cant explain your solution to an open and intelligent mind, its not a good solution.  Some advice for Classic and supporters So it appears the hard fork is happening. A lot of people have fought hard to raise the blocksize limit for a long time, using a variety of means, and it seems to be happening at long last. Core didnt take the last available opportunity to include a blocksize limit lift in 0.12, but have announced the release candidate without that feature. So this is it, this is when the fork happens or doesnt happen. Right now, based on announced support, the fork appears to be moving forward. A lot of people supporting Classic are feeling a lot of relief, even if people know that this effort is not done until the blocksize trigger has activated on the network. Its far from there at this point - theres not even deployed code. But everything seems to be going the right way. Its important to reflect on how this is more than a discussion on features. This is an election of what people decide get to _decide_ on the features, direction, quality, and vision _moving forward._ And as Satoshi declared, theres only one thing determining the outcome of the election: what code is producing the longest chain. Thats how bitcoins democracy works, right there. This is not a selection of features. Its much bigger than that. Its an election of governance and stewardship into the future. As in most elections, there has been a lot of animosity - in both directions. As heels have been dug in, ditches turned to trenches, and preferences turned into prestige, people are starting to call out each other and accuse the other side of not working for whats best for bitcoin, and actively naming specific names in negative contexts. When those in power do this to you, youre feeling everything in the book between resentment, belittling, and outrage. Its easy to do the same thing back. There have even been suggestions that Core is deliberately sabotaging bitcoin to the benefit of ... a selection of actors. This creates a toxic culture leading up to the election point, where people are afraid to take bitcoin-positive initiatives in anticipation of all the negative attention that follows - for in such an environment, practically all attention will be negative. It doesnt help that people incumbent in positions of power tend to \"do what they must, because they can\" in order to safeguard the status quo, however small or insignificant that incumbency is - this includes everything from Theymos deletion of discussions, via the silly DDoS attacks on XT nodes, to LukeJRs poison pull request to Classic about killing all miner hardware investment. Actions such as these are not really excusable, but they are still human: people tend to do the very human mistake of letting the ends justify the means, with the ends being what _they_ believe is best for the bitcoin network. Of course, other people disagree of whats best for the bitcoin network, and toxicity follows until the conflict is resolved. And beyond. The toxicity will _remain_ until actively removed by leadership. It is the responsibility of the winner in any rift to end a toxic animosity culture of hostilities and personal adversarialism. I cannot stress this enough. History is full of examples where the winners refused to live alongside the losers and rebuild the world together once the conflict was resolved. It never ends well. On the other hand, where the opposite has been true - South Africas end of segregation with Mandela as president comes to mind as a good example of leadership here - people learn to put animosity behind them. A lot of people who have submitted code to Core (and previously) are skilled coders, after all, working from their vision. This vision doesnt have to be incompatible with Classics vision in the slightest - it may just be a matter of slightly different feature priorities, with people intending to get everything in there anyway. (Id also therefore like to praise Jonathan Toomim for not engaging in the rifting but focusing on _solving the problem_ to most peoples acceptance. Real MVP right there.)  Finally, some personal reflections Unfortunately, I believe bitcoin development has lost touch with large-scale rollout necessities over the past year or so. At the moment, there are three use cases which all new features should seek to improve: Remittance. The act of sending money between individuals in different countries. Drop-in credit card replacement, from the perspectives of both the payer and the merchant (two different use cases). This means that a payment must be instant, easy, and much cheaper than a credit card settlement. These three use cases must be front left, right, and center when doing any design on the bitcoin network, as far as Im concerned. They also reinforce each other when funds received by remittance dont have to go via fiat to be used for purchasing something. If theres no profit to be made in using bitcoin as a drop-in replacement for credit card payments, bitcoin will not be deployed at scale. Deployment and outcompeting legacy systems depend entirely on merchant financial gains from rollout. The story begins and ends with this observation. Thats why Im concerned when Im looking at the features of 0.12. I dont see any features targeting one of these three use cases. Fact is, I see at least one feature severely degrading the drop-in capability of credit card replacement - RBF - and the lack of scaling severely jeopardizing, not to say ultimately removing, the profitability in replacing credit cards. What I see is instead engineering for the sake of engineering. The question of \"whos the customer?\" seems to have gotten lost in the process. While its arguable that theres no customer as such in an open source project, theres nevertheless an importance in understanding where the _front bowling pins_ are for a disruptive technology like this - and its certainly not in the one-time initialization time of starting up a new node. Id argue that the front bowling pins instead are the three use cases I listed above, and would love to see a stronger focus on tangible use cases moving forward even if people disagree with my choice of cases. Onward and upward. Bitcoin will recover and move on. Lets learn from this experience. \n",
      "We made \"Welcome To The Blockchain (The Bitcoin Song)\" about a year ago. We decided to make the song available for free and to solely rely on Bitcoin donations. Even though we had seen the generosity of the Bitcoin community several times in the past, we didnt expect to receive any significant amount in tips. To this day, after 32,000 plays, weve received 138 tips from all over the world for a total of just over 1.5 BTC. This is a lot of money for two struggling artists and its far more than we ever expected. It demonstrates the viability of this technology for content creators. Thank you again for your generosity, and we hope that our song can continue being somewhat of an anthem for the growing Bitcoin community. If you havent seen/heard our song yet: Tips: peace!\n",
      "Just tried to buy my first bitcoin on LocalBitcoin and now I understand what everybody has been saying. What a total nightmare, there are so many hoops to jump through, ID to send off, over inflated prices to pay... Sorry, as long as it is that complicated and fussy to buy it will never become mainstream. I want to enter my Visa Debit number and get bitcoin, thats how every other online transaction works. I dont want to photocopy different parts of my ID, send it to a stranger, wait for them to look at it, wait for them to verify the transaction and pay a massively inflated price for the pleasure and very few others will want to either.\n",
      "Im so sick of what I read here. Big Blockers are to blame if a hardfork destroys bitcoin, big blockers are to blame if all the talented devs leabe ... STOPP IT! Devs will not leave because classic forces them to 2 MB. Or will they? Will they do the Mike Hearn and leave, cause there was one decision that was not theirs? Dont insult the intelligence and the motivation of hundreds of developers. Than: dont blame big blockers, blame core. Especially Greg Maxwell, who wrote the roadmap, and those who presented it to the rest of core as a solution for consensus. Consensus is NOT cores consensus alone. Consensus means the whole network, it means the miners and the economy and the users. And as you see now, the roadmap has NOT the networks consensus. Core devs aim is to keep bitcoin secure. The roadmap was a failure in this regard. The problem was Core devs are blind on non-technical issues. It would have been enough to say, after 1,5 years of discussion, \"we raise the limit to 2MB\" to stay save and to prevent a hardfork. But Core choosed to take a solution that they say is technically superior. I dont know if SW is that. But I know that if you consider Bitcoins as a techno-social protocoll, the roadmap is TECHNICALLY the most dangerous decision, cause it leads into a hardfork, and this was clear since day 1 after its release. \n",
      "I was harassed online before for speaking about it and am going to use a throwaway now. First they introduced Bitcoin XT, then Bitcoin Unlimited and now Bitcoin Classic. Every time they fail to force their ideas they change the name and try again to fork the network. Instead working towards a solution for the scaling problem they change their opinion daily. First they need 8Mb blocks, then 4Mb and now 2Mb is also ok after everything else failed. There was 0 research done how big the blocks need to be. They are constantly playing a guessing game just to get it their way. Nobody is blind, we know that bitcoin will need scaling to support millions of users, but spreading a panic around while I never had to wait for a transaction is just crazy. We are not going to be late for anything. There is enough time. The price is dropping, core developers are stopping to support the project and new developers are coming in just because they are the ones supporting their big block ideology. But at the same time the new developers bring their own ideas and are starting to revert changes that have been long in the making and discussed. And now a whole set of new changes is proposed to be maid with the big block increase. There a multiple open pull requests to Bitcoin Classic that are being not openly discussed anywhere else. There are also some trolls, but most of them are centred around cleaning the mess after a hard fork, not taking in account the bigger picture. If you look at them it will be obvious that \"short term solution\" or \"for now\" are the dominant sentences. Why are they gaining so much support? If you read their comments its extremely worrying. Most of them argue that the price drop is good, because it will scare the miners and investors and force them to adopt their solutions. Is this how we are going to gain consensus, out of fear? For months now they are trying to sabotage this project. In the beginning this ideas looked ridiculous, but just by brute force they managed to force it somehow and are gaining a lot of momentum. Arbitrary changing the protocol looked impossible, but now multiple hard forks look like a good idea.\n",

Ive only just started looking into it and have a basic understanding of things, when responding if people could use layman terms Id really appreciate that. So its probably a awkward time Ive picked to start looking into Bitcoin with the amount of media flying around that Bitcoin is dying. Ive quickly come to the conclusion with the strong community and thousands of businesses globally each year taking on Bitcoin and investing into it I doubt its anywhere near dead. I am trying to research why people dont like Bitcoin and attempt to understand the flaws people see in Bitcoin. Doing my research all the arguments Ive come across on why Bitcoin is flawed and those requesting a Bitcoin version 2 are centred around anonymity and the fact you cant really back charge payments. To me these \"flaws\" are nothing to do with Bitcoin as a system and are easily resolved using 3rd party websites/middlemen/companies that can prevent both of these problems/issues. Is there anyone who can help me understand any valid flaws in the Bitcoin system and why people are requesting the need for a v2 of Bitcoin or better system, I simply dont understand and would love to get a good idea why people see Bitcoin as missing some key features for my research.

      "Bitcoin at its most fundamental state, is an open and permissionless public good. Many people now and into the future will rely on \"on-chain\" transactions for a vast array of reasons. We are not here to question those reasons. It may be for a private sale of expensive art or it may be for a company like factom who uses the blockchain for their entire platform to operate. It is naieve to expect everything to run on the lightning network bar a few highly congested settlement transactions per person. LN is fantastic and absolutely has its place in bitcoins future. But to limit bitcoins utility as a global public good by limiting its blocksize, forcing people onto a layer 2 payment network will in itself strangle bitcoins utility as a base layer for trust and innovation. Bitcoin is only as good as its utility, and its utility is in its open permissionless frictionless access to a public ledger. That can never cease to exist because the second it does is the second bitcoin looses its utility as a global public good. We need both. Bitcoin should always grow to allow as many on-chain transactions as the global population require from this public good. And we also need LN style payment channels for convenience. Allow the block size to grow with demand. Implement LN when its ready. No one should be dictating how big or how small a block should be.. It should be a floating function based on demand for the utility that this global public good provides. Miners will naturally set their block size at a size that is convenient for them (getting the most amount of transaction fees by including the most transactions) whilst limiting themselves to their bandwidth and storage capabilities. IF bandwidth naturally limits blocksizes globally over the long term in the future, yet growth and demand continue, fees will rise.. that higher fee incentive will drive some smart people to find a way around the problem and those smart miners will grow their blocksizes to capture the fee reward, thus balancing the supply and demand equation and bringing fees back down.. mining the optimum blocksize will become an industry just as hash rate has become an industry.. do we limit the hash rate, no, so why should we limit the blocksize. This will be done at the same time developers implement new and exciting features to increase bitcoins capacity like segwit. Miners creating an entire optimum blocksize industry, along with capacity increases from devs like segwit, In unison will make bitcoin an unchallengable open permissionless public good. Edit: censorship resistant features in core along with every miner switching to p2pool to reduce centralisation should answer any other concerns. (We need a single everyone switch to p2pool day.. worst case u loose a days profit, if it works mining centralisation probelms fixed). A.k.a. if every miner including the large pools all switched to p2pool, censorship would be impossible and centralisation impossible. meaning blocksize increases are a non issue, and we can have both blocks that grow with demand and as many layer 2 payment networks as we like. Heck, there may even be a way to make a core designated version of p2pool and enforce it as mandatory from a core level. If it helps the protocol grow it may be a good compromise. One single mandatory p2p mining pool in core.\n",
      "Bitcoin by nature is anti-equality. The more industrious rise above those who are less industrious. It does however create an actual level playing field so those who have potential to be industrious can reach said potential. Thus rises the situation where a majority believes they are being oppressed by minority declaring the system a tyranny when this isnt really the case. Bitcoin is ultimately controlled by the economic stakeholders who have risen to power through hard work. Those who have the most Bitcoin did so by: buying early, creating a profitable Bitcoin business, doing something useful for the economy. This reality holds true because of date no scammer with has retained access to Bitcoin wealth. They are inevitably excised from the system like a cancerous tumor. Whats happening now is a phenomena Ive never witnessed first hand only seen theorized in textbooks. The majority screams for a dissolution of the tyranny but really have no idea what they are actually revolting against. Meanwhile the industrious will remain industrious and continue to become more wealthy by profiteering on the emotions of the vocal majority. What will inevitably happen is the economically weak majority will end up losing their chance at accumulating wealth for a cause they feel is noble but without real contingencies or suitable insurance a slew of middle men will profit on their would be endeavors leaving them just as poor and weak as when they believed they were oppressed. \n",

      "The Blockchain didnt get the memo. Bitcoin has failed, according to one Bitcoin developer. Its doomed. For the 89th time, the Bitcoin experiment was declared dead. The blockchain doesnt know this, and is still quietly and consistently collecting, compiling, and reconciling the ledger, creating new blocks, every ten minutes, non-stop. By the time I finish this article, it would have issued 25 new bitcoins at least once or twice, just as it has done for the last six years without fail. Ten minutes after Mike Hearn declared it failed and dead, it just added a new block to the chain and it will keep doing so, until it doesnt. Transactions were made, money was sent, money was received, and the price went down and went up. The blockchain doesnt care. There is no plug to pull. It has no feelings. But every ten minutes, it takes a step forward, and increases its value and its network strength. No one person or one organization can stop this. Every ten minutes, it trudges forward. Every ten minutes, the ledger is verified and updated. As Bitcoin and the Blockchain moves forward, so does the industry behind it. Thousands of developers, entrepreneurs, investors, and users are using it as I write this. The Blockchain doesnt care – there is work to do now, and every ten minutes or as long as it is alive. Until it actually stops, then it hasnt. It just keeps moving forward, one block at a time. \n",

      "If mining continues on the original chain, there will be two coins -- Bitcoin (original chain) and ClassicCoin (big blocks / hard fork chain). The original chain can persist regardless of how much more hashing capacity mines on BItcoin Classic. These two coins likely will differ greatly in price. Perhaps a Bitcoin will trade at $100 and a ClassicCoin will trade at $250. But what if at the time of the fork you had bitcoins deposited at an exchange? How will your exchange handle this situation? Does your exchanges terms of service (ToS) address this situation? If not, might your exchange just claim \"we use Bitcoin Classic and follow the chain with the greatest work\" and use that as justification to steal your $100 bitcoin? There are arguments that they legally wouldnt be able to do that: But are they prepared (or preparing) to support handling of both coins? Not a single exchange has mentioned this as something they are working on, or planning on even! Perhaps everyone thinks that this is something that can be addressed later. But once Bitcoin Classic is released, the hard fork can come as soon as 5 weeks later! If blocks are full already, how will the Bitcoin blockchain handle all the withdrawal requests once people realize they should pull their coins from exchanges and hold the private keys themselves? If this added transaction volume causes a fee market to develop, will the withdrawal transactions from the exchanges (who generally pay the fee for withdrawals) get confirmed even? Or will those transactions instead be left on the sideline while other users transactions where the appropriate fee was paid get included instead? tl:dr: The exits are extremely narrow. The time to get your bitcoins off the exchanges is NOW!\n",
      "It seems like we are headed for a controversial hard fork of bitcoin. Basic rules of the protocol are being changed, despite the majority of technical expertise being strongly opposed, and all the negative downfall of splitting the community.

      ">And surely, it is important that we should know how to listen without making a tremendous effort to understand. When we make an effort to understand, our energy goes into the effort rather than into the process of understanding. Very few can listen without resistance, without creating barriers between themselves and the speaker; but if we can put aside our particular opinions, our accumulated knowledge and experience, and listen easily, without effort, then perhaps we shall be able to understand the nature of the fundamental and radical transformation that is so essential in a crisis of the present kind. >Now, it is obvious that there must be some kind of change. We are at the edge of a precipice, and the crisis is not limited to a particular group, religion, or people, but it is a crisis that involves us all. Whether you are an American or a Korean, a Japanese or a German, a Russian or a Hindu, you are affected by this crisis. It is a world crisis, and to understand it fully, if one is at all serious about it, one has obviously to begin with a fundamental understanding of oneself. The world is not different from each one of us. The worlds problems are your problems and mine. This is not a histrionic assertion but an actual fact. If you examine the matter closely, go into it fully, you will see that the collective problems are the problems that confront each one of us individually. I do not think there is a division between the collective problems and those of the individual. The world is what we are; what we are, we project, and that to us becomes the world problem. >So, to understand this extraordinarily complex and ever-increasing problem that we see in the world, we have to understand ourselves - which does not mean that we must become so subjective, so inward-turned, that we lose contact with external affairs. Such an action, such a process, is meaningless, it has no validity at all. But if we can see that the world crisis - the confusion, the tragedy, the appalling murders and disasters that are taking place and are going to take place, this whole beastly mess - if we can see that all this is the result of our own daily life and action, of our particular beliefs, both religious and national, if we can see that this world cataclysm is a projection of ourselves and is not independent of us, then our examination of the problem will be neither subjective nor objective, but will come about through quite a different approach. >Now, we generally approach a problem of this kind either objectively or subjectively, do we not? We try to understand it either on the objective or on the subjective level, and the difficulty is that the problem is neither purely subjective nor purely objective, but is a combination of the two. It is both a social and a psychological process, and that is why no specialist, no economist, no psychologist, no follower of a system, whether of the right or of the left, can ever solve this problem. The specialists and experts can attack the problem only in their own particular fields - they never treat it as a total process - and to understand it, one must approach it in its totality. So, our approach to the problem can obviously be neither subjective nor objective, but we must be capable of seeing it as a total process. >To understand the world crisis as a total process, one has to begin with oneself. Outwardly there is constant war, conflict, confusion, misery, and strife; and through it all there is the search for security, for happiness. Surely, these outward problems are the result, the projection, of our own inward confusion, conflict, and misery. Therefore, in order to solve the external problems, which are not independent of our inward struggles and pains, we must obviously begin to understand the process of our own thinking; that is, there must be self-knowledge. Without knowing ourselves fundamentally, both the conscious and the unconscious, there is no basis for thinking, is there? If I do not know myself deeply, at all the different levels, what basis is there for my thinking, for my action? Though this has been said over and over again by every preacher since the beginning of time, we go on disregarding it because we think that by environmental change, by altering outward circumstances, by bringing about an economic revolution, we can transform fundamentally the process of our thinking. But surely, if we can look at the problem a little more closely and ardently, we will see that mere external alterations can never bring about a fundamental revolution. Without understanding the whole process of the self, of the me, the process of our own thinking, the inward confusion in which we live will always overcome the cunning reconstruction of outer circumstances. >So, it is important, is it not, for those who are really serious, who are in earnest, who are not just flippant or pursuing some sectarian belief - surely, it is important for such people to begin to understand the process of their own thinking. Because, after all, our thought is the response of our particular conditioning, and there would be no thought if there were no conditioning. That is, whether you are a socialist, a communist, a capitalist, a Catholic, a Protestant, a Hindu, or what you will, your thinking is the response of that conditioning; and without understanding that conditioning or background, which is the you, whatever you do, whatever you think, must obviously be the response of that conditioning. So, to bring about a fundamental revolution, a transformation in oneself, there must be the understanding of the background, of the conditioning influences which create the process of thinking; and this self-knowledge is the beginning of wisdom. >Most of us, unfortunately, seek wisdom through books, through listening to somebody; we think we will understand life by following experts or by joining philosophical societies or religious organizations. Surely, they are all escapes, are they not? Because, after all, we have to understand ourselves, and the understanding of oneself is a very complex process. We do not exist at only one level; our structure of being is at several levels, with different entities all in conflict with each other. Without understanding that whole process of the self, we cannot finally solve any problem, whether political, economic, or social. The basic problem is one of human relationship, and to solve that, we must begin to understand the total process of ourselves. To bring about a change in the world, which is obviously essential, we must be aware of all our psychological responses, must we not? To be aware of our responses is to observe them without choice, without condemnation or justification - just to see the whole process of our own thinking in the midst of relationship, in the midst of action. Then we begin to examine the problem in its totality, that is, we are aware of its full scope; and then we shall see how our responses are conditioned by our particular background, and how those conditioned responses are contributing to the chaos in the world. So, self-knowledge is the beginning of freedom. >Now, to discover anything, to understand what is truth, reality, or God, there must be freedom. Freedom can never come through a belief; on the contrary, there is freedom only when the conditioning influences of belief, and of the process of memory, are understood. When there is that understanding of its own process, then the mind is really still, spontaneously silent; and in that silence, which cannot come through any enforcement, there is freedom. Then only is there a possibility of discovering what is real. So, there can be freedom only with the understanding of the self, of the me, of the whole process of our thinking. >There are some questions, and in considering them, may I suggest that you and I should both try to discover the truth of the matter, and not merely wait for an answer. Life has no categorical answer of yes or no. We must go into each problem very deeply, and to go into it deeply, we must begin very near and follow it closely without missing a step. And if we can take the journey together and discover the truth of these problems, then no expert, no pressure of public opinion, no immature thinking, can ever obscure that which has been discovered. ~Jiddu Krishnamurti \n",

      "It might be said that classic and alternative \"clients\" could be a benefit to the community simply because they are mobilizing scaling improvements faster than they otherwise would have been. Maybe Segregated witness would have been a slower process had there not been controversy. But maybe that also wouldnt have been such a bad thing due to the idea that having rushed code could be bad. Or is that underestimating Pieter Wuille? >( from Sergio Lerner, prominent Bitcoin core dev) from BitcoinClassic Slack Channel: sergiodemianlerner 5:29 PM Regarding SegWit, I dont know if you have actually looked at the code but the amount of code changed, including consensus code, is huge. (maybe ~500 lines). I think such change has never been attempted in the history of Bitcoin. We cannot just say lightly that a couple of weeks after the 2mb hard-fork were going to deploy segwit. That code needs months of review. Also Im against the complexity of segwit as a soft-fork (probably requires 200 additional lines of code of consensus critical code). Segwit almost prevents consensus-compatible re-implementations of Bitcoin in other languages. If the community and miners cant fork from a developer team, then all it would take to control and take over bitcoin is the ability to control a select group of people with commit access. There is the possibility in the near future that an artificial fee market develops and a severe backlog of transactions happens. When that occurs, transactions will be pushed off the network. Maybe they are spam transactions. Maybe they are transactions that go to another place such as paypal or another coin. When there is a severe backlog of transactions you have the problem of unreliability. When does your transaction confirm? Maybe its 1 hour. Maybe it is 5, using your wallets best guess. Thats probably the point of opt-in RBF... so you arent stuck.(There are some reports of businesses using the network already experiencing these kind of problems and we arent even in the severe backlog days) The classic team is (for the better part of my knowledge) releasing code at the end of January where it will be in review for 2-4 weeks and then deployed where the activation happens 2-4 weeks after that. So You could have a double in transaction capacity by sometime in March. Segregated witness on the other hand has gone live on the test net. Some estimates say that once it is deployed (I heard April, but maybe sooner?), that its deployment will take a year afterward for all the software required to use it. If it is fully 100% deployed and everyone uses it then it will give us an effective capacity of 1.75MB (Still less than the hard fork option). The point is that if the network has the capacity now to do something it should take the better short term can kick. It makes more sense to slow Segregated witness down. Test it more, and think about doing it as a hard fork instead of a soft fork. Sure, SW has other benefits besides increased transaction capacity. Like fixing malleability. But in the short term, not kicking off some people who transact with bitcoin, not scaring future investors because of how \"inflexible\" bitcoin is and not stalling growth is a smarter move. There have been many people lately who have warned about this. Stalling growth, premature optimization... things like this can have effects that can result in slower growth and increasing popularity of alternatives. Lastly, there is that issue of hard forks. I hear a lot of people defending the core developers and saying that they plan to hard fork after segregated witness at some point. The argument against hard forks gets stronger over time. If they wont do it now when there are people clamoring for it then why would they ever do it? Keep in mind that soft forks are just as powerful as hard forks and that they could in the future hack a solution using something called \"extension blocks\" to keep the network going. on an interesting note according to maaku7: >It will activate probably weeks after it is deployed, and the second question is irrelevant. It does not matter how many people have upgraded for you to experience the benefit of segwit. If you have a client generating segwit transactions they will be counted as about half as big regardless of how many other people have upgraded. That means people who use upgraded wallets will immediately be able to get the benefits of SW. That might hasten deployment faster than some think. But it also probably means people with hardware wallets and less informed users are SoL. It might be that eventually bitcoin cannot scale past a certain point of growth, and that some kind of backlog of fees will be inevitable. But lets not rush that. Lets instead do the simpler solutions that we know work and prepare the more complex solutions in the meantime.\n",

Assuming these companies have a 100% reserve of everyones coins, then the only real risk is risk of theft or hacking. Then these types of companies can offer insurance to protect against theft, and possibly charge customers a small fee to store and warehouse their bitcoins.

      "\"Peak prosperity can only be achieved through individual freedom, free markets, and sound money.\" Bitcoins ecosystem has individual freedom, and sound money.. but does not have free markets. A 1mb limit is the opposite of a free market. If the blocksize limit was a free market, users would put upwards pressure on the blocksize with their fees and miners would put downwards pressure on the blocksize with their race to propogate.. finding a beautiful equalibrium entire ecosystem defined blocksize. Miners would be in a race to propogate, leading to advances in bandwith usage, and more competitive mining practices world wide. Devs would be in a race to implement alternatives like LN to enable efficiencies and increase censorship resistance. And users would be ina race to confirm their transactions leading to a floating fee based on the networks efficiencies.. the more efficient the network the smaller the fees, and the devs and miners would be working to make the network as efficient as possible. Leading to overall lower fees.. If fees arent enough for miners they will scale back allowing more efficent players to enter the market. If spamming occurs filling up blocks fees will rise temporarily, making the attack unsustainable. Also an equilibrium based blocksize limit wont adjust instantaneously it will be a floating function over long periods of time which will allow for the blocksize to remain in place to withstand the duration of the attack. (Also if its an obvious attack miners can choose keep their self imposed blocksize limits stable to protect the network, this come back around to game theory/ protecting their investments). Moores law/ decentralised storage networks take care of storage issues for nodes, and capitalism will provide many many mining farms in every country on earth in the near future keeping the network decentralised. Take from this what you will. \n",

The current monetary system is failing and it may collapse faster than many think. We need to be ready. Having Step 4 come before Step 3 is a tactical mistake.

Just fine, absolutely dandy! Real spirited, always even handed never outside consensus. Im not sure if hes doing this because hes ~~emotionally unstable~~ addicted to starting controversy or just doing this for fun to get a rise out of people, but one thing is clear, hes a minority and is often the black sheep of the core maintainers. Its very difficult to take anything he says seriously. The possibility of a Hardfork to change the mining algo on the PoW is a valid and real option, but as sipa said he would strongly oppose such a action if it did not maintain a high degree of consensus and only if the community banded together to decide to switch it. This is kind of like a nuclear \"emergency\" button only to be used as a last-last resort situation if it became clear that the centralization of mining is actually threatening the most valuable features of bitcoin. We all know that the danger is real. But we are no where near that point. Anyone who is saying that Core will change the PoW are using appeal to fear fallacy to manipulate you into siding with them.

      "Strange times, perhaps for some. I can give sentiments from western Canada that I think can hold relevant to anyone across the world. People here are in despair. MOST of my peers are home from the oil fields but not all (yet!?). We (should) know low oil and gas prices favourably effects the consumers cost of living, but there is no faith in such economics and this is a lagging phenomenon (seems to be kicking in right now!). What media and social media hasnt seemed to pick up on is the question of who holds their power in the price of oil? Around here people think its families. Canada really changed under the “oil regime”. And so what happens now? >In the near future there may be a smaller number of currencies used in the world and these may stand in competitive relations among themselves. There is now the “euro\" and the lira is past history now. And there COULD be introduced, for example, a similar international currency for the Islamic world or for South Asia, or for South America, or here or there. And what is the relevance of bitcoin to this global “recession”? Im rather more interested in understanding the block size debate and Satoshis relation to it. It seems to me when “Satoshi” was sitting on the solved puzzle that was bitcoins code/implementation he had to ponder the fact that a limit was needed to defend bitcoin vs ddos attacks. Then of course there is the realization that this is not a very scaled solution in regard to a global currency. So then there is the philosophical question of whether or how bitcoin might be scaled in the future. But even layman seemed to have pointed out the intrinsic difficulty of convincing a growing population of a single consensus for significant change. So I think then there is at least the possibility for intuition, and another conjecture that bitcoin CANNOT be scaled. It wasnt really a choice you see. And it could NEVER be explained the general public, because the exact problem that Satoshi was solving was the publics inability to cooperate (thats what money is FOR!). If there is any truth or possibility to it, Satoshi would never enter such a debate because its not actually a debate, but just ignorant people needing to realize there can be no other way (nor should there be!). But what I am hoping we start to understand as we see this change in the world that could not have been predicted but by either a “genius” or Satoshi, that John Nashs Ideal Money can not be about anything but bitcoin. There is then the possibility Nash had a hand in bitcoin, or that he intuitively new that such a thing would soon exist. Bitcoin is not the whole story, Ideal Money is, Im sure of it. >And this parallel makes it seem not implausible that a process of political evolution might lead to the expectation on the part of citizens in the “great democracies” that they should be better situated to be able to understand whatever will be the monetary policies which, indeed, are typically of great importance to citizens who may have alternative options for where to place their “savings”.\n",

      "Hear me out before downvotes: I would love to stick with the core developers. I keep reading guilt tripping post after post about how everyone else sucks and the core Devs do all the work and so on. I even agree with these statements. That conversation with Toomin was facepalm worthy. But I simply cant understand then why Core is so damn hardheaded about this issue. The blocksize proposals have literally come as low as they can get. It started at 20mb increasing over time to 8gb in the future, then dumbed down because China said 8mb was the best they could do, then it shrank again, then again, and now people are simply asking for a 1mb increase to handle the current increase in traffic and move us forward. Yet to JUST get this compromise we are still forced to hard fork both the development and the blockchain. Everyone says how bad it would be to do this and yet core has not given a millimeter in this so called \"compromise\"! Why!? What is 2mb going to do to drastically centralize or destroy bitcoin? Why are we STILL fighting over this and having to oust the entire development team to get any blocksize increase at all?. The Core developers have it entirely in their power to prevent the move to classic and the risk of having someone like Toomin be in charge of anything. All they have to do is prove that they will listen to the community and the miners. If they increased the blocksize themselves, to the widely agreed upon and clearly not bandwidth straining size of 2mb, this issue would be over. If the hard fork comes, and the Toomins turn out to be inept and there is some blatant problem with no developers to work on it. Ill find it very difficult not to be mad at Core for letting it happen when the power to prevent it was literally laid in their lap. If Core wants to stay, prove it by actually listening. \n",
      "I have been saying for a long time that I believe politics, not mining fees, will ultimately sustain the network past the days of meaningful block rewards. I believe if we have a successful hard fork then we have moved one decisive step closer to this reality. The costs associated with sustaining the network ultimately represent voting power over the future design of the network. These votes only have political power, however, if it has been shown that actual elections can be successfully held, perhaps even regularly, without detriment to the system. If we do hold one such election, this demonstrates that politics are consequential to Bitcoin in a more tangible way that previously imagined, that politics is a source of tremendous power, particularly as Bitcoin continues its sometimes seemingly inevitable ascent. Power is the heart and soul of money, it is appropriate that power lies at the foundation of the Bitcoin system. Once it becomes clear how important having a vote in the future of the network becomes, and that control of the instruments used to sustain the network are the key to having this vote, then profit ceases to be the sole incentive for mining or running nodes. The larger and more consequential the network becomes globally, the more the incentive moves from profit to politics. And that will happen precisely in line with the decline of block rewards. If the currency becomes powerful, mining fees will not be necessary. If the currency is extremely valuable, the network will be sustained purely so powerful parties can dictate its future. Those parties may be nation states, those parties may be masses of individuals, it is not clear, but miner fees will not be a necessary incentive as having voting power becomes the greater concern. This nature of Bitcoin, the fact that it is open to political capture and control, will actually make Bitcoin more trustworthy as a global system, not less. The reason there is trust in modern central banking is because of the impression that their command structure ultimately derives from a democratically elected government. To the ever increasing extent that people understand that these institutions are not really democratic at all, and representative more of the banking system than of the government, trust is eroding. Trust, the foundation of money, lies in part in the perception that the system is fair. More important, trust in a monetary system depends on the perception that that monetary system exists for the benefit of your people. Trust in national currencies stems from trust in national governments which are clearly meant to represent the people of the nation. But trust in a transnational currency will be weak if the impression is that that currency is ultimately designed to benefit one group of people at your expense. The currency must be perceived to be neutral. This can never be achieved if there is only one set of developers, or a company that makes the code. It can only be achieved from a currency in which control over the currency can be swapped with voting power. I have been, and continue to be in support of the core developers and their proposals. I respect their concerns over big blocks and centralization. I believe the core devs are best kept \"in control.\" But ultimately I believe that if a hard fork is successfully completed, it will actually move Bitcoin forward. \n",

      "This is a copy from another bitcoin related subreddit, made by ( maybe someone will find it interesting. An announcement was just made by the Peoples Bank of China regarding a symposium held today in Beijing with potential implications for bitcoin and the Chinese version has already started to make the rounds on the English web, but there appears to be no English version available, yet. Well not anymore! In this very special edition of the /r/btc China Dispatch, I have translated the full text of the original announcement. It’s late here and I’m operating on only a few hours of sleep, so the translation may be a little rough around the edges, but hopefully still useful to the community. Peoples Bank of China Digital Currency Symposium Held in Beijing The Peoples Bank of China Digital Currency Symposium was held in Beijing on January 20, 2016. Digital currency experts from the Peoples Bank of China, Citibank and Deloitte & Touche engaged in a discussion and exchange regarding several topics including overall frameworks for the issuance of digital currency, national digital currency in the context of current currency developments and state-issued cryptocurrency. Peoples Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan attended the meeting, with Peoples Bank of China Deputy Governor Fan Yifei chairing the meeting. The meeting was also attended by experts from related research institutions, major financial institutions and advisory bodies. The meeting pointed out that as information technology has developed and technologies such as the mobile Internet, trusted and controlled cloud computation, secure terminal storage and the blockchain have matured, significant changes in payment methods have occurred world-wide and the development of digital currencies presents both opportunities and challenges to the issuance of currency by central banks. The Peoples Bank of China has taken this subject seriously, establishing a special research team as early as 2014 and further bolstering said team in the beginning of 2015. The team has since conducted in-depth research on various subjects, including frameworks for the issuance of digital currency and related business operations, key digital currency technologies, environments for the issuance and circulation of digital currencies, legal issues faced by digital currencies, the effects of digital currencies on the economic and financial system, the relationship between fiat digital currency and privately issued digital currency and international experience in the issuance of digital currencies. The meeting stated that under Chinas new economic normal, the exploration of the issuance of digital currency by the central bank has positive practical significance and far-reaching historical significance. The issuance of digital currency can reduce the significant costs of issuing and circulating traditional currencies, improve the convenience and transparency of economic transactions, reduce money laundering, tax evasion and other criminal acts, enhance the central banks control of over the money supply and currency circulation, better support economic and social development and aid in extending financial services to under-served populations. Going forward, the establishment of a system for issuing and circulating a digital currency will help China build an entirely new financial infrastructure, further improve Chinas payment systems, improve payment and settlement efficiency and promote increased overall economic quality and efficiency. The meeting urged the Peoples Bank of Chinas digital currency research team to actively incorporate important results and practical experience from digital currency research performed within China and abroad as well as continue to advance their work on the basis of their preliminary work, establish more effective organizational safeguard mechanisms, further clarify the strategic objectives of central bank digital currency issuance, thoroughly research key technologies, research various applications for digital currency and strive to introduce a digital currency issued by the central bank as soon as possible. The design of the digital currency should be based on sound economic, safety and service principles, ensure a low cost of use for the digital currency and wide coverage, achieve seamless integration of the digital currency with other payment tools and enhance the usefulness and vitality of the digital currency. While moving forward with research into digital currencies, the Peoples Bank of China has established communications channels with relevant international agencies and Internet companies and has conducted extensive discussion with domestic and foreign financial institutions as well as traditional card-based payment operators. Both Chinese and foreign nationals who participated in the discussions take this work very seriously and conducted in-depth exchanges with experts within the Peoples Bank of China system regarding related theoretical research, exploration of applications / practice and development pathways.

      "Why is there such a rush to raising the blocksize limit right now at this very moment? Conversely, why is there such staunch resistance to raising the blocksize limit, and keeping it limited forever? Bitcoin would survive in the short term under either scenario. Holders will still hold. Miners will still mine. Developers will still develop. Nodes will still exist. Companies will still build applications on top of the protocol. Yes, all players will have to adjust, but thats what life is all about. Adaptation is paramount. Bitcoin is a dynamic system. Yes, some players might lose out on the margins depending on the blocksize, but the core fundamentals of Bitcoin will survive in the short-term-- and that short-term will be long enough for everyone to understand the ramifications of a blocksize increase or keeping the blocksize at 1MB. But ultimately, under either scenario, the system will be stronger for it because we will have learned more about how the Bitcoin protocol would work in a 1MB blocksize scenario with full blocks and upward transaction fee pressure or a 2MB blocksize scenario with greater pressure on miners and nodes. Regardless of what decision is made on the blocksize limit, the community can always correct its mistakes if it is determined that there is a more optimal solution. But we cant be afraid of simply taking a position, and sticking to it for the short-term to see how it plays out. Im pretty sure the price of Bitcoin wont tank to zero. It might go down a lot, or it might go up a lot, but it wont spell the end of Bitcoin overnight. There seem to be two options. We can either raise the blocksize to 2MB or we can keep it at 1MB. But either decision should be made with the clear caveat, that NO DECISION IS PERMANENT. Neither of these decisions will kill bitcoin overnight nor will the community irrationally stick to that decision if it appears it was a mistake. The only thing that will kill bitcoin overnight is if everyone decides to sell and quit. If we raise it to 2MB and realize that Bitcoin is weakened, then we can put the limit back to 1MB. If we keep the limit at 1MB and realize that Bitcoin is weakened, then we can raise it to 2MB. Bitcoin is an experiment, so LETS EXPERIMENT. But lets do it in good faith. Lets do it without the ill-will and ad hominem accusations. Lets do it without accusing others of ulterior motives. Perception is reality. When people see the Bitcoin community in the light that Mike Hearn left it in, then they see a weak system-- regardless of the fundamentals. This impacts bitcoins ability to grow. The only way Bitcoin is going to fail in the short-term, is if people decide to quit in the same way that Mike Hearn did. Because ultimately, Bitcoin is a choice. Its a choice about creating a new paradigm, or staying trapped in an old paradigm. People are free to come and go as they please. Yes, you could argue that there are other alt-coins and blockchains that offer a better paradigm, but none of those other alternatives have anywhere close to the market value of bitcoin. For better or worse, bitcoin has created millions of individuals who have a vested interest in their pocketbook for it to succeed. So in order for bitcoin to succeed, we need to remind ourselves that we still have the 1 cryptocurrency on earth. The first mover advantage gives us the ability to experiment with the system and adjust different levers. Adam Draper is right. Bitcoins current problems are social NOT technical. The players at the top, the bitcoin brain trust, need to realize that both sides of the blocksize debate make good points. However, they also have to realize that nobody actually knows the future of either scenario, because nothing like Bitcoin has ever been tried before. All I know is, regardless of the decision, Bitcoin will survive long enough to correct any mistakes from that decision-- if there are any. We just need to accept this reality, and change the perception of our debate. Its not life or death. Its not all or nothing. Its not \"Mike Hearn is a traitor.\" Its not \"Bitcoin Core devs are hi-jacking the system.\" Ultimately, a 1 or 2 MB blocksize will not alter the fundamentals of bitcoin. A 2MB blocksize will show us what sort of impact a small blocksize increase has on the  of nodes broadcasting transactions. It will also show us if a small blocksize increase has any impact on the economics of mining. Yes, some nodes may drop out, but a lot of nodes will continue to process transactions because miners also run nodes, and miners have a vested economic interest in bitcoin. This will be very important for us to observe and measure if we decide to go with a 2MB limit. Conversely, keeping the blocksize at 1MB will show us how transaction fees are impacted by completely full blocks. It will show us how a transaction fee market might develop by keeping the blocksize limited to 1MB in the face of increasing transaction volumes. It will show us the types of users that put the most value on super fast transactions that confirm in 10 minutes or so. This will be important to observe and measure if we decide to keep the limit at 1MB. We stand to learn a lot about the bitcoin system under a 1MB scenario or a 2MB scenario. Bitcoin has this amazing quality of bending, but not breaking. Whatever decision is made wont change the fundamental rules of bitcoin. Blocks will still be created every 10 minutes or so, people will still trade it on exchanges, and it will still have value-- for at least another few months. The reason that is true is because a large number of bitcoin users are long-term holders. Holders are prepared to ride this thing out to the end, because most of them only invested money they were prepared to lose. At the end of the day, I still support the fundamentals of Bitcoin at a 1MB or 2MB blocksize. The reason for this is simple: Because Bitcoin has been a better store of value over the last 6 years than any other currency on earth. Neither a 1MB or 2MB scenario is a must. The only thing that has to be done is to humble ourselves and allow the process to play out. No one has all of the answers. We need to learn a lot more about the economics of bitcoin before we can firmly decide whether the blocksize should be always be increasing or if there should always be some sort of rigid limit. But the only way thats going to happen is if we accept that a decision must be made. Once we accept that, we need to prepare to diligently measure the impact of a 1MB or 2MB limit on the system, take notes, discuss, and then reevaluate. Whether its a 1MB or 2MB limit, its time for the community to take a leap of good faith-- together. We will end up being much stronger for it. \n",

Big blocker: the underprotective father who just wants his kid to get out and enjoy life, learn from life and grow with life (block size increase), even if he needs a push (hard fork).

      "Hello all, This is my first post so I will introduce myself as an outsider in the sense that I am not an engineer nor do I work for any Bitcoin company. I have a financial/investment background, do not own bitcoins but could imagine doing so if certain (probably obvious) development hurdles are achieved. My self-assessment of Bitcoin expertise on a scale of 1 (\"isnt Bitcoin a ponzi?\") to 10 (\"I am Satoshi\") is around a 3. My question pertains to the issue of tx fees for on-chain transactions; if tx growth outstrips max block size (or effective max block size with SegWit) and a transaction layer solution is lacking then a fee market will develop. Ive seen some commentary in the Core roadmap and other materials relating to fees but certainly not anything that I personally would consider sufficient for what would be a significant change to the characteristics of Bitcoin. Relying in part on Jeff Garziks characterization that \"notable\" Core devs aim to have a \"healthy fee market\" develop for on-chain transactions, can someone from the 1M max block size camp explain what the tenets of such a fee market are?  Do Core devs supporting 1M blocks want to cull low-value transactions from the blockchain? If so, why?  Is the aim to have a fee market develop more about funding mining as the block reward diminishes?  Do Core devs supporting 1M blocks want most transactions to move off-chain, resulting in capacity headroom on-chain and thus low fees with 1M/small blocks?  If the issue mainly relates to funding miners, are 1M devs of the view that it is not possible to fit enough tx on-chain to fund miners with low fees per tx without centralization (ie 8GB blocks), and thus the system needs to adapt to have miners funded by a smaller number of higher value, higher fee on-chain transactions?  What has Satoshi said about funding miners once new bitcoin issuance reaches zero?  Are fees really a side issue for 1M devs in the sense that they are more concerned with centralization (or some other issue relating to the scaling debate), and see growing fees as a negative but comparatively better characteristic than their perceived threat of centralization?  Is there any consensus among Core devs on fees? Im interested in the issue of a Bitcoin fee market in a general sense so any commentary outside the direct scope of these questions would also be appreciated! Also, I am going to preempt those who will be tempted to post about Core wanting to push tx onto Blockstream solutions and all comments of that nature. I dont care for these opinions. Many thanks\n",
      "It is expected that miners will make their decisions to maximize their profit. If a hardfork has occured, they will mine the side of the fork whose coins are most valuable, thereby following economic consensus. Unfortunately, to minimize risk hardforks need to be guarded with a consensus threshold; the protocol doesnt allow for miners to efficiently \"try\" a hardfork. This means that miners need to make the decisions before the actual hardfork occurs, and have to resort to social media, developers advice, political arguments and heated debates to predict economic consensus and make their decision. Wouldnt it be valuable to set up a future market where stakeholders can pledge to future contracts trading coins on both side of the fork? This way miners can make safe predictions, and mining consensus is guarded to follow economic consensus. A notable issue would be, that the \"losing\" side of the fork, might lose by such big numbers that that chain will no longer mine any blocks, and the losing coins can no longer be transferred. If these risks are clearly stated, this shouldnt be a problem as in such case it can be expected that the value of the losing coin would be close to zero.\n",
      "Increasing Bitcoin bloksize limit issue is provoking fierce disputes within our community. There are so many people, including many big players/known people/companies support it.

If we think it is necessary to increase the blocksize limit to a higher number, and maybe the sooner the better, can we provide some hard evidence/data to prove it?

      "Im not a blockchain newbie (generally speaking, some of you might say that I am) but I have two basic questions that I am unable to answer. 1. My understanding is that mining powers the network. What I mean is that (I think) the computer power that goes to processing and updating the ledger is contributed by the miners. I am also of the opinion that the miners are getting compensated for their service in bitcoin. They are making money by mining. My question is this: what happens when all of the bitcoins already exist? What is the incentive to keep mining if there are no more bitcoins coming into circulation? Who will power the network if no one is mining? 2. How is it that each miner has their own copy of the entire blockchain? My understanding is that all transactions are verified by consensus, and Ive heard that each of them has the whole thing, rather than just a piece. How is it that each miner has the entire blockchain? Isnt it like a huge file? Do they have to keep track of every single transaction? How does each of them have the whole thing?

      "Its hard for me to understand why so many in this community here do not get the following basic fact about how Bitcoin works: Of the alternative blockchain histories created by a fork its the one that best represents the interests of the majority of the mining power that will survive. Those interests can in essence be summarized as The value of Bitcoin shall be preserved. (This is obvious, since otherwise mining would be utterly nonsensical.) This in turn is in the interest of anybody holding bitcoin. What that means is that the [software creating the] blockchain will choose the path that is best for Bitcoin, no matter what. In particular, the fate of Bitcoin is independent of communities or religious wars between them. This is also independent of the name of a community, be it called Core or Classic. If you now find yourself thinking: But if we build feature X into Bitcoin, then this and that, which is clearly bad for Bitcoin., well, if you are right, feature X will certainly not be on the winning path, and if it will, you will get proven wrong after all. This is evolutionary selection at work. This is the unique cleverness behind the design of Bitcoin. Therefore. A fork that would destroy Bitcoin is impossible. A new feature that would destroy Bitcoin is equally impossible. What DOES hurt the rate of adoption of Bitcoin, is when the Bitcoin communities communicate as if the fate of Bitcoin was in the hands of individual developers. Potential adopters observing the conversation are upset. Articulations of beliefs by frustrated Bitcoin developers that Bitcoin be dead dont help either. This kind of observable misinformation may have negative impact on the price of bitcoin short term. But none of this does influence the technical soundness behind the concept of Bitcoin, nor the self-protecting features built right into the Bitcoin network.\n",
      "1. Increasing the block size is not as important as some people think. In short, bitcoin does not scale very well and is already now unsuitable for micro-payments. Doubling the block size will merely kick the can down the road, good enough for a little while. The solution will be micro-payment systems added on top of bitcoin. 2. When predicting the impending demise of bitcoin and panic-selling bitcoins, people forget that the whole block size discussion is caused by bitcoins overwhelming success. This is a problem every startup longs to have, the new business bursting at its seams, requiring extension. As someone nicely put it, this is a champagne problem.\n",
      "Web video in the early 2000s was choppy and low res. Increasing the bandwidth of every connection wasnt a viable solution. Instead, video codecs were improved upon that compressed video smaller and smaller. Each generation increased compression by perhaps 50% and just when you thought a lower bitrate wasnt possible, new ideas where conceptualised and implemented. Being smart and re-structuring data is a better approach than using the sledge hammer of increasing block size.. at least until we run out of options, which we dont appear to be.\n",

      "I am not a trader. I use mycelium with a coinapult usd lock account linked to hedge volatility. As the price falls I hold in usd, as the price rises I hold in btc. That is the extent of my trading. To move between these accounts it requires an on-chain transaction to take place. If that doesnt happen I loose money. Full blocks are preventing average users who wish to use decentralised wallets from hedging. This will push more and more users onto centralised services which cannot be a good thing for the ecosystem. The whole idea of bitcoin is decentralisation, however full blocks are forcing more and more users onto centralised services just for the abilty to hedge volatility, or use bitcoin at all. Finally this ecosystem supports decentralised hedging but now full blocks are taking that feature away. How is this a good thing? Edit: having full blocks also hinders the development of all other decentralised innovations including openbazar etc. Allowing full blocks is the same as saying \"centralize all the things\". \n",

      "Miners are generally rational economic actors. They mine where the return is greatest. So, simply those not wanting a Bitcoin Classic hard fork can help prevent that by paying an [edit: additional] subsidy to miners that are not mining with that client. This tactic can be applied only when needed -- when Bitcoin Classic activation is getting near. For example, lets say 65% of the last 1,000 blocks were marked with support for Bitcoin Classic -- a level dangerously close to the 75% activation threshold. Announcing this additional mining subsidy at that time might help persuade enough mining towards the Bitcoin Core pools such that the Bitcoin Classic block count drops to a safer level (e.g., 55% or less). At that time, the promise of a subsidy can be withdrawn. The subsidy can be paid out to the coinbase address(es) of only new blocks that are not marked with support for Bitcoin Classic. A subsidy of just a few bitcoins per block might be more than enough to persuade a miner to switch pools or a pool operator to change the client/protocol supported. This technique is a double-edged sword however. Theres nothing stopping Bitcoin Classic supporters from employing the same approach -- subsidizing blocks that do have marked support for Bitcoin Classic to help get activation to occur sooner. But if \"unconventional tactics\" are needed (see ), this is one to consider.\n",

The following is the translation and the original text of one paragraph from the article, content within the brackets are my commentaries.

When talking about Bitcoin Classics releases, Jeff stated that a hard fork is needed for the upgrading and improvement of the source code(the original Chinese are weasel words and possibly syntactically incorrect), yet(and) without providing a clear long-term roadmap(about what lies ahead of the 2MB increase?), which led to almost universal dissatisfaction(correction: the author later edited his article to change the \"almost universal\" to \"some\" , apparently due to a protest from one attendant who did not disapprove) among those present, whom further expressed their withdrawal of support for Bitcoin Classic, and the need to reach a wider consensus within the community before a decision can be made. The original: 昨日，bitcoin classic的开发者Jeff 从纽约飞来北京，与中国比特币企业haobtc、okcoin、bitmain、Bither, LIGHTNINGASIC等召开沟通会议，以期获得更大支持。在会议上，Jeff在阐述bitcoin classic版本时说出还是需要硬分叉来实现代码的更新换代，同时在对远期发展没有明确的规划。这点引起在座某些成员的不满，表示不再支持bitcoin classic版本，需要达成更广泛的共识再做表态。\n",
      "Today bitcoins biggest use case is speculation, making trading a huge part of its usage. If traders cannot trade in and out of btc because of full blocks it renders that usecase moot leading to a huge number of users giving up trading. Causing a potentially huge drop in demand and therefore in price, damaging reputation etc etc. I use mycelium android, I have a coinapult usd account linked, As the price falls I hold in usd as the price rises I hold in btc.. Thats the extent of my trading. But for that to work i need to be sure that my transaction from mycelium to coinapult goes through otherwise I loose money! Full blocks prevent the average person from hedging against bitcoins volatility. Finally average people have the ability to hold btc and hedge reducing their volatility exposure, and full blocks are taking that feature away. Full blocks will effect bitcoins largest use and drive that market away effectively reducing adoption in a massive way. For me full blocks mean reduced trading, reduced adoption and a falling price as a consequence.. Long term the price cannot grow while velocity is limited! \n",

      "Everyone read the blog from Mike Hearn: >From the start, I’ve always said the same thing: Bitcoin is an experiment and like all experiments, it can fail. You can call it whatever you want, but as a proof of concept, it was successful. It is now a network worth a lot of money, and there are quite a lot of transactions. We have by far passed the point of no return. It will simply not happen that the project is declared as a failure and then being terminated. The question is where it will go next. As there is no one in formal control, it will not follow the usual ways. To some extent, it behaves like Open Source projects, but with a crucial difference. Open Source projects can fork and continue to live separated. Eventually, one fork usually turns out to be superior, and the other fork is discontinued. For Bitcoin, a situation with a fork will probably be resolved in a matter of hours. The future expectations on Bitcoin are very different. All the way from being good enough as it is, to ultimately becoming the dominant currency of the world. It will most probably fall somewhere in between, but with hard fights between rivaling groups. If there is a clear majority for a change, I think this is unstoppable. That is a beauty of the system.\n",

      ",Scenario: Youre looking to interview an \"expert\" on Bitcoin and its utility. Should you bring in an \"economist\" (Paul Krugman, etc.) or a \"developer\" (CS degree, or similar)? Opinion: Bring in the developer! Always! Justification: What is Bitcoin? \"Is it electronic gold\"? \"Digital cash\"? These are not definitions; theyre just helpful metaphors. At a fundamental level, Bitcoin is open source software. Nothing more… nothing less. It is code. And, being code, it must be understood first as software (and what it \"does\") as opposed to as legacy money. To attempt to analyze Bitcoin first as \"money\", as Krugman does, is to completely dismiss, with absolute certainty, the possibility of any application(s) that does not fit into the current definition of what money is. A developer will look at Bitcoins source code and see it plainly for what it is. In his frame of thought, hes likely to see money, in the traditional sense (for things like in person purchases), as only one potential, and quite trivial, application. But he wont see that application as what Bitcoin is. An economist is more likely to not actually see Bitcoin for what it is and, therefore, make a judgement about its utility in the market based on one narrow application (traditional payments). He or she may even make quite perplexing comments like \"we already have credit cards for that\". An economist is liable to catch the \"digital gold\" metaphor and immediately stop reading further, due to their own prejudice or bias. Even if theyre correct in their opinion on gold, its completely irrelevant because gold is, yet again, just a helpful metaphor for the unimaginative. And its a metaphor for one application (store of value), nothing more. A developer envisions Bitcoins potential for international remittances. He or she partners up with a friend, and founds a company like Abra. And, for the economists in the crowd (like a Krugman), Abra is only possible because of Bitcoins P2P, decentralized nature. To put it simply, \"no\", this cannot be done with credit cards (but its a nice thought). A developer envisions Bitcoins potential for micro-transactions, to pay per article (new sites), remove ads, etc. A developer envisions Bitcions anti-spam potential. Imagine if every email, one day, required an attachment of a single satoshi? For the typical worker, sending 100 emails per day, it would be insignificant. But for spammers, it would bankrupt them. Extrapolate. A developer might envision \"smart contracts\", contracts essentially written in code, that are deterministic and trust-less. API micro-services. Machine-to-machine transactions. Injection into any environment where market dynamics (supply/demand) aid in resource allocation. A developer acknowledges that there is a spectrum of potential applications, only a fraction of which have been realized. Some will never be realized, and many more will be unexpected. Anyone is free to debate the utility (or lack thereof) of any of these applications, and others, but they arent free to immediately dismiss all of them as 0.00% probability events. Any rational understanding of Bitcoins utility (and the value of \"bitcoins\") is, thus, derived from the totality of its current and future applications, adjusted for their likelihood. And the most logical way of reaching this conclusion is, first and foremost, to understand Bitcoin as software, not money. Discuss...\n",

      "I posted this as a comment yesterday, but I think it could use more discussion: For a long time I have waivered back and forth between the blocksize/hardfork debate. I do believe I have settled my mind on the issue. Listening to Jamie Dimon speak about governments attempt to shut Bitcoin down \"if it gets too big\" reminded me really what it is we are up against. Bitcoin seeks to displace centuries old power structures, and they certainly wont go without a fight. Weve been ignored up to this point, but now financial institutions and governments are taking notice. Bitcoin must remain as decentralized and censorship resistant as possible. If we create a situation where nodes and miners have no possibility of operating anonymously, then they could theoretically all be targeted. Increasing centralization decreases the targets. If for some reason major governments, the US, Russia, China, and the EU decided to outlaw bitcoin and/or create onerous regulations, a highly decentralized network would be able to adapt. People would be able to mine behind TOR and VPN, people in South America and even some places in Africa could keep mining on. Jamie Dimon makes it clear that he will use his influence to try to crush Bitcoin if it becomes a threat to his empire. I want Bitcoin to be as resilient as possible to any and all of these threats. Additionally, a hardfork without a true state of emergency demonstrates that this currency and network can be changed by the will of the majority. We do not want a currency and network controlled by a political process. Yes the Core maintainers are a small group, but Bitcoin will grow beyond Core development. As the ecosystem grows, it will become more and more difficult to make any changes that are not absolutely necessary. This is a great property of Bitcoin, to be absolutely resistant to change. It inspires confidence that other parameters wont be changed in the future. Another point I want to bring up is the halving we will experience later this year. We all want to believe that the price will increase significantly in response to the halving. This is far from guaranteed. A rising fee market will help subsidize miners during what WILL be an incredibly volatile year. We, as the Bitcoin community have created something the world has never seen before. Bitcoin is worthless if we make it fragile enough to be ruined by State sanctions. Bitcoin is invaluable to me because it is anti-fragile. \n",

      "So if you look at [the current state of the bitcoin network]( We have approximately 220000 transactions over the last 24h. Thats 2.5tx/sec which is pretty much near the maximum capacity of the network considering the 1MB cap, but lets not talk about that here. If we look at what our beloved miners received from the system for securing our transactions (~1,500,000USD), that means we have paid them around 7USD per transaction. Now, the mining business isnt exactly a good business, they dont actually make a huge profit out of mining. Which mean that 7USD is pretty close to the price they paid for the equipment, maintenance and electricity cost. Now its going to be difficult to infer what is the actual ratio of this costs, but if we assume a very conservative 20% for electricity. Thats about 1.4USD of electricity. If again we take a conservative price (to try to reduce the kwh/tx!) of 0.1USD/kwh. Thats about 14kwh of electricity per transaction. To be honest, this is a very conservative estimate. Probably its 2-3 times this. Now I have an electrical car, and with 17kwh, I can drive in average 100km. So that means that in term of energy expenditure, I could have driven around 100km in my car instead of buying that burger with my bitcoins. Whats your take of this?\n",
      "I know this has been asked a lot, but Im still not sure the best way to do cool storage. Use case: keep a lot of money in cool storage and regularly refill my hot wallet (no more than 1x per week). Features: Secure, lasts a long time, can be backed up securely, family can access it if I die or if I forget my password, simple as possible. Options: 1) Encrypted paper wallet with passcode. SSS my passcode to my 2 family members + me to recover passcode if I forget or die. PITA to use spend from. 2) Wallet file encrypted by EncFS. SSS my passcode to my 2 family members + me to recover passcode if I forget or die. Maybe not so secure to store to use EncFS in an online system. But my family would also easily have access to the rest of my computer, which is nice. 3) Use encryption software directly on the wallet. SSS the passcode, and give family a copy of my wallet. 4) Hardware wallet. Seems to take the risk out of using an online system. But I still have to find a way to securely store the recovery key + security card and split it up to family. It seems like thats back to square one (i.e., securely storing 24 recovery words is about as hard as securely storing a private key). I guess the idea is that I could backup the recovery words slowly like the paper wallet, because I wouldnt be using it so frequently? 5) Some fancy 2FA wallet like greenwallet or coinkite? 6) Some fancy use of multisig? (Keep in mind, my family may not be so great at using bitcoin or securely keeping their keys.) 7) Something else? Should I use HD wallet? (Whats the point? I can just create a 10k addresses and back them up once...) Should I split funds across multiple wallets and software (redundancy seems like a good defense against a bad RNG or a bad luck)?

Is this to be the norm for the foreseeable future until people are sure of Bitcoins roadmap? Needless to say, I am rather new to Bitcoin. I have about 1.5 bitcoins as a mini-investment, and am just interested to see it go up and stay up, if and when it does. Anyone else have any theories, or been keeping track of the varying values and the radical turbulence from the past few days?\n",

If we all are completely 100% honest owith ourselves, what is the likelihood of blockchain technology succeeding and bitcoin completely failing. What would be the potential scenario(s) of bitcoin failing? Similarly what would be the potential scenario(s) of Bitcoin completely shitting on all of these smug pricks saying \"blockchain is amazing but bitcoin is dead\".

      "So we all know there is a massive debate going on right now based on centralization and the amount of nodes. The idea being bigger blocks hinder individuals from hosting full nodes. But, what if nodes only had to initially sync with a single hash before begining their host, and didnt have to hold the entire blockchain to host. There is a company you are hopefully all aware of called factom, they can hash any amount of data into a single hash creating an imutable audit trail that can be verified by a single hash. Imagine taking the entire blockchain, and hashing it into factom which ancors that hash into the blockchain every single block. It is like the blockchain providing a secure hash of its own current state that nodes can then work off to help host the network. This would allow nodes to host in a secure and trusted way without holding the entire blockchain. There will of course be archival nodes and the entire blockchain kept on these archival nodes and also kept on platforms like storj which are decentralised and can keep archival nodes synced as a public good for reference etc. But hashing the state of bitcoin into the blockchain itself after every block would allow nodes to host without any storage or bandwidth restrictions. Anyone could then host from their mobile phone in an app. Obviously I havent thought through the technical details and I may be completely missing something. But it sounds like a technical possibility, somehow. Regards.\n",
      "Apple have approved our bitcoin geocaching game \"takara\" on the iOS app store. [Download]( \"takara\" means treasure in Japanese and the game lets users drop bitcoin in the form of jewels anywhere in the world. However users must go a location takara has been dropped to pick it up. Users can added a message and question to the bitcoin they drop. Advertisers can also attach a custom banner and link to their site. The app also has a built in secure wallet. We hope that businesses will drop bitcoin at their store to attract customers! Checkout our demo video here [Watch Demo]( Although the app is live dropping bitcoin is currently disabled for a few days, this is because we want to invite users to try and spoof their location and collect some takara we have dropped in Antarctica Some of you may know that geocaching games are subject to \"location spoofing\". We have special algorithms to detect spoofing however for the users sake we would like to do the due diligence and make sure the app is as secure as possible. When dropping takara users are told to add a question that only somebody at the location would know, and that if they dont they run the risk of their takara being collected via spoofed location. If all goes well dropping takara will be live in a few days, if not a new app with a slightly different model will be released. Please report any bugs or security holes to admin@mandelduck.com and follow our [facebook]( or twitter @mandelduck for updates. Thanks Chris MandelDuck n.b. An Android version is planned, however bitcoin security is a little trickier on Android compared to iOS hence the delay. . . . . Here is also some security info A lot of people have been asking about the security of the app, do I store private keys? what about location spoofing? etc. Here are my answers I have special algorithms to detect location spoofing however I admit this is not 100% spoof proof. The app warns the user of this when they drop bitcoin and tells them to add a question and answer that only somebody at the location would know. The private key of the bitcoin is then stored on our server, the private key is encrypted with the answer to the question. We do not store the answer, meaning that even we cant decrypt the private key without getting the answer right. This also means if the server is compromised the private keys are encrypted. The app has a secure wallet built in and signs all its transaction on the app meaning the private key of the users wallet never leaves. The private key of the users wallet is stored in the iOS keychain. Having said this I will be honest and I dont promise 100% security, the app is a game not a secure exchange.\n",

A public address is 160 bits and a private key is 256 bits, this is a savings of 37.5% if you want to store a random 256 bit number. The problem is the length of the private key makes it have 2256 possibilities and take forever to crack. I want to shrink this private key to near 222 bits or or 4,194,304 possibilities. A desktop computer should be able to crack this new address in 1 or 2 seconds, a graphic card even less.

      "Some thinking together. The argument the halvening will bring great value to bitcoins price is for some based on valid logic I think for others a misunderstanding of economics. In other words I think it is somewhat true this halvening will raise bitcoins price, I believe the theory and \"belief\" by knowledgeable players is that the value of bitcoin in relation to its monetary supply is such that its \"price\" SHOULD rise gradually over time. That is to say since the markets are well aware of the inflation schedule for all time they are able to immediately adjust to it and so there should not be such an immediate change on the day of halvening. Players in the great game should be able to speculate the increased pressure on the bitcoins price and so speculators will begin to buy bitcoin slightly before this event. And so of course some smaller savvy part of the population is expected to invest earlier and so on until present time. However, in its infancy I think that bitcoin is susceptible to what people will often refer to as types of speculation attacks. In this regard we would be looking at an attack on its price stability (even though stability includes a gradual upward trend). When bitcoin is mature we should expect it to be free from manipulation and hype in this regard. So in the beginning halvenings might likely have a greater effect than the later halvenings in its monetary supplys life cycle. This is important in relation to our global financial system as the real price discovery of bitcoin occurs. Again there is optimized theoretical conjectures in regard to optimally decentralized mining pools, fairness and equality in the cost of production, perhaps fungibilty, and other contributing factors that might change or not be ideal for consideration and study in bitcoins infancy. My basic point is that what we are seeing today is a very interesting phenomenon with respect to our national money systems. As bitcoins value in relation to its cost of production is discovered, it must be that any national fiats that take a dive vs bitcoin while other fiats hold steady or a reasonable relation to each other and bitcoin, MUST have lost their quality. bitcoin cannot reasonably decrease or increase in value for say a Canadian dollar if the Canadian dollar stays on par with the rest of the world currencies while the world currencies simultaneously stay on par with bitcoin. As the exchange markets for fiats/bitcoin grow we should expect this phenomenon of the markets highlighting the quality of each currency to grow. For this observation it seems to be that we are in the infancy, not necessarily of the adoption of bitcoin as a world currency, but rather a new gold-like standard in which all of the national fiats are now necessarily measured in relation to. \n",

      "Its really quite interesting I think, perhaps we can read it together: >The Confessional of Targeting >It was the observation of a new \"line\" that has become popular with those responsible for \"central banking\" functions relating to national currencies that gave us the idea for the theme of \"asymptotically ideal\" money. >The idea seems paradoxical, but by speaking of \"infla-tion targeting\" these responsible officials are effectively CONFESSING that, notwithstanding how they formerly were speaking about the difficulties and problems of their functions, that it is indeed after all possible to control inflation by controlling the supply of money (as if by limiting the amount of individual \"prints\" that could be made of a work of art being produced as \"prints\"). >This popularity of the line of \"inflation targeting\" seems to have started in New Zealand, which is the place, among the USA, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, which had the most depreciated dollar. And we can note also that New Zealand was hardly a place where any crisis of poverty really forced them to not maintain the value of their dollar but rather just a place where \"Keynesian\" thinking was probably very influential. >If now we think of a world of a number of major curren-cies and with all of these provided by central authorities that operate under some sort of a ritual of \"inflation targeting\" then, as things evolve, what SHOULD the targets be? >It is only really respectable that there should not be an arbitrary or capricious pattern of inflation, but how should a proper and desirable form of money value stability be defined? >Rapid inflation is easily measured, on a national level, by a domestically defined \"cost of living\" index. So if the cost of living, as measured by another agency than central banking authorities, were not rising (when expressed in terms of the domestic money) then one could feel assured that there was not inflation. >However this requirement is actually a little too strong (for a properly good money worthy to be called of \"ideal\" type)! It is actually quite natural for the calculated \"cost of living\" to be rising, even when meas-ured, say, in terms of gold, whenever there is so much technological progress that the people in an area, without working harder, are lifted to a higher standard of living by the rapid progress, as if each human would become the beneficiary of the assistance of 3 robot helpers to do the work of his livelihood. >So in the last years of the era of the gold standard the \"cost of living\" measures were gradually rising, in “advanced countries”, but it was not appropriate to view that as indicating inflation since the money was not losing value in relation to alternative options for \"treasure hoarding\", (such as gold!). >To be quite respectable, in a Gresham-advised sense, money needs only to be AS GOOD as other material commod-ities that might be hoarded. It does not really need to be so good (as time passes) that the cost of living statistic should remain constant. >But \"inflation targeting\", unless all major currencies would (somehow!) be able to be adopting and really employ-ing the same target rate, would still provide the oppor-tunity for \"connoisseurs of quality\" to rank the currencies in hierarchies of gradations of quality (like bond rating agencies rank the debt of commercial enterprises or like other rating agencies comparatively appraise various insurance companies). Those really having lower planned inflation rates would naturally be seen as superior in quality. (We should note that the INTERNATIONAL perspective relating to a currency is not how it relates to domestic-ally measured costs in its home country but how it compares, on the international markets, with other currencies and commodities.) >What inflation targeting does is to open up the possib-ility that somehow the various major currencies may evolve to develop stability of value. And in this sense there could be \"asymptotically ideal money\" in that an evolving trend could lead to the value stability that would consti-tute a major improvement in quality.\n",

      "Bitcoin fees should be calculated based on current fiat currency value. The way it is done now by just putting .0001 BTC or a multiple of .0001 BTC based on the size of the transaction is unsustainable. If the value of a bitcoin rises quickly no one will want to ever transact in bitcoin OR if it drops less miners will want to continue as the block reward decreases Examples: X100 (1BTC = $40,000 USD) At this point .0001 = $4. That would be the fee for the small size transaction. A default $4 fees will make buying anything in bitcoin (outside of large purchases) undesirable. X.01 (1BTC = $4) Now .0001 = $.0004. Default fee per transaction is too small. Even if the blocks are full, will bring a miner less that $1 USD per block. (excluding block reward) If wallet code was written to allow the user to decide the fee for the transaction based on current fiat valuation as the multiplier it will always be somewhat reasonable, even in wild fluctuating times..

      "We know that the mainstream future users of bitcoin will not be running full nodes unless its inbuilt into their connected devices in the future automatically. They just dont care or dont have the knowledge or time to bother. Every user of bitcoin who is going to run a full node is already running one. So there is no reason to expect the full node count to increase into the future in the short-term regardless of bandwidth or storage restrictions. But do you know who does run a full node or multiple full nodes today? Companies building on blockchain technology! And they have the funding and capital to keep them up and running full time forever into the future, because their entire business depends on it for multiple reasons. Do you know what full blocks, an increase in the backed up mempool and rejected transactions does to these companies? It destroys their use case and business model and in turn puts them out of business along with their full nodes. Not raising the block size will force many companies who use bitcoins blockchain to either go out of business or switch to a different blockchain for reliability. Full blocks increase centralisation for many reasons but the two most concerning are:  A reduction in transaction throughput will make many startups use cases redundant, destroying those businesses which will lead to a reduction of full nodes. Along with discouraging new startups that would have hosted a full node but now dont.  Flaky and expensive transactions will force users off of client side decentralised wallets and onto centralised bitcoin bank wallets just to be able to transact in a reliable manner. By the core devs own admission, even with segwit and LN in place we will need block size increases into the future regardless. Why risk destroying every start-up building ontop of bitcoin today by not doing something that needs to be done anyway! Especially taking into account that the longer you wait the harder it is to implement. TL;DR Claims are that a block size increase will slow down the growth of full nodes. My argument is that by not increasing the block size (allowing full blocks / dropped transactions / high fee transactions) you destroy many startups using bitcoin in the process and they are the ones hosting many full nodes already, so by not raising the block size you wil actually reduce full nodes and increase centralisation! Please explain to me how discouraging other platforms to build ontop of bitcoin therefore no longer hosting a full node is beneficial. Example, Factom. A platform that hashes data into the bitcoin blockchain for security. If there is no blockchain transaction capacity increase, they will have no choice but to move their entire business model onto the next most secure blockchain just to operate with reliability, taking their full nodes with them. That is one example of literlly hunderds. So there goes 1000 full nodes just like that.\n",

      "Proponents of btc infrastructure that have no means of actually contributing, other than a vocal presence, are an extension of the greater fan club. Buttcoiners dont exist so much anymore, mainly because they have been proven futile in their rhetoric. Not by logical arguments, but by time and consistency, they have been proven wrong and wrong again. So whats the next step? The next step is to continue the same rhetoric, but under the guise that they are for bitcoin. The next step after that is that they might actually purchase some bitcoins, or maybe they have, and theyll escalate a step and get some miners working for them; directly or by extension. If a buttcoiner can feel like they convinced a miner to change for them, they feel like theyve contributed to the protocol and themselves, so they are justified both in their contribution to the network, and the reservation of their individuality, even if their aims are shortsighted. Of course, this will only continue for so long, and Id like to say they could succeed. But I cant say that they will because I do not feel that, and it would be dishonest to say what I dont mean or feel. Encourage a buttcoiner to contribute to the network. Its okay to disagree, but its better for them to have a try rather than not. Its better to be inclusive existentially as opposed to complete alienation. More for btc, either way. Keep on fighting everyone. Youll get to where you are going. These steps are a few of the first of the rest. Now, I know some people thought they started out for btc but then changed their minds. But does that mean they arent a buttcoiner? Or does that mean they were a buttcoiner all along? Maybe somebody didnt have the foresight in what they were committing to, and therefore mispoke? I think it is okay, that happens. For me, I feel like I shouldnt be surprised by this influx of rhetoric in the blocksize consideration. After all it is the last thing that concerned be before going full bitcoin. The concept didnt stop me, as I saw that btc is still a better vehicle in something that could be diluted. I am sure I am not the only one who thought this as thoroughly as I did.

In my humble opinion the entire Bitcoin Experiment is under attack. The Banking Industry (the few in charge of it) declared all-out war on this experiment. All means of war are acceptable. Those in charge well understood that Bitcoin Experiment is far beyond the scope of how the material things are controlled. (but we understood it also :) ) If the experiment succeeds, the entire society will move up to the next step on the Maslows pyramid of hierarchical needs. If the experiment fails, we will step down to the world of techno-slavery. The Soviet Union 2.0 analogy comes to my mind. The outcome of the experiment is the ultimate statement about us - the society. Will the GOOD prevail or will the EVIL succeed? P.S. Check this link (bullet 3) and make your own judgement.

      "There is an infamous slack dialogue where jtoomim opened up the most, so far, about his plans for btc classic. He expressed the feeling that miners securing the system of btc wasnt enough of a vote, and that another voting layer should be introduced to the protocol; more specifically, one where the user base can vote on changes in the protocol. The implication was that mob rule could change any quality of the protocol. \"Adding democracy to democracy\", if you will. Its redundant. The network develops consensus via mining. Why open loopholes into the security system? I can understand, and even respect, the strategic method in which classic has come about. However, I do not understand why this \"voting mechanism\" isnt widely scrutinized. How is anything other than the choices a miner makes in securing a protocol, a valid vote to consider? This rhetoric has \"opened a can of worms\", and I see how the slippery slope develops here. The most dangerous element, is when mob rule transcends miner/hashing security--bitcoins primary asset. I do like the idea of a \"cryptocurrency\" whose protocol can be voted upon to instigate changes; but why does it have to be bitcoin? There is a dialogue on slack that emphasizes this aspect.

      "According to the usual narrative, there is a trade-off between decentralization and block size. Actually, the whole ongoing debate revolves around this trade-off. In this post, I will convince you that there is no trade-off at all and that we can actually have both. The most commonly used metrics for decentralization is the number of full nodes in the network. Larger blocks makes it more expensive to run a full node, thus one can expect the ratio of users who do so to decline. However, larger blocks also mean that the system can support more users. For example, if half of all the full nodes give up when blocks increase to 8 MB in size, it would still be a win for decentralization as there would be four times as many transactions and thus also approximately four times as many users. Under these assumptions, a block size increase to 8 MB would double decentralization as measured by the number of full nodes in the network. The key question to ask here is: what percentage of users would give up their full node when running one gets more costly? Are some critical levels to be aware of, i.e. the typical throughput of a tor connection? (According to [tormetrics]( it takes about 10 seconds to download a 5 MB file at average, so there does not seem to be an immediate bottleneck.) A similar argument can be made for the other popular decentralization metric, the distribution of hashing power. Larger blocks allow for higher total fees per block, and thus more total income for miners and thus also more hashing power in the network, which increases security. As long as it stays below a few seconds, block propagation time is a secondary concern and overshadowed by other economic factors, such as the variation in electricity prices. For example, if electricity prices vary 20% between locations, this completely overshadows the benefit of getting the latest block 6 seconds faster, which increases expected revenue by maybe 0.01 BTC per block (1% of fees), or 0.04% of income (0.01 BTC / 25 BTC). Thus, larger block sizes can be a win for both, decentralization (more full nodes) and security (more hashing power). Lets hope the technical limitations to do so are fixed before the network gets overly congested.\n",

      "So I have long been thinking of a way to secure my funds using a multisig address but the tools available may not be around forever and storing the redemption script along with other private keys is annoying.

But this is still risky. So I was thinking of adding extra backup/redundency by taking the private key derived from the brain wallet and encrypting that with a familiar password. Basically it would be an encypted paper wallet which is also a backup of an extremely high entropy brain wallet. However, bitaddress.org only allows you to encrypt a randomly generated private key, not a private key of your choosing. What is the best and most secure way of achieving this.

      "There are 3 major projects to consider:  Networking improvements (IBLT/weak-blocks/thin-blocks)  Protocol improvements (SegWit)  A hard fork (block size limit increase; protocol cleanup) The hard fork acts as a kind of sequencing point that determines the order in which to introduce changes; nevertheless, we can all work in parallel on these projects, and then trigger together one, beautiful, clean hard fork to last for a good while and set the foundation for future improvements. However, this distribution of effort will not work unless we trust each other, so let us come to an agreement about what needs to be accomplished. ------------- Here is the logic of the situation. Rolling out networking improvements will make it safer to increase the block size—even if you dont believe that there is a danger, it will at the very least render those fears silent; thus, it makes sense only to do a hard fork after improvements to networking:  networking improvements; then a hard fork. Furthermore, a single hard fork at the end of any sequence is a way to introduce cleaner implementations of the already-deployed protocol features—not just implementations of something like SegWit, but implementations of anything else; a hard fork is an excellent time to clean up Bitcoin. Of course, this alone implies that its best to perform a hard fork after getting SegWit up and running for a sufficiently long period of time, so that a cleanup effort can account for observations made during real-world usage; hence:  protocol improvements; then a hard fork. Now, a protocol improvement like SegWit will potentially tax the network with greater throughput, so it could be argued that networking improvements should be deployed before SegWit:  networking improvements; then protocol improvements; then a hard fork. However, tuning the parameters of networking improvements such as IBLT/weak-blocks/thin-blocks implementations is still a matter of ongoing research, whereas SegWit is nearly ready to go; furthermore, it is useful to give SegWit ample time to deploy, so as to get real-world feedback. Thus, Bitcoin Core devs have decided its best to get SegWit out the door as soon as possible; all of their effort has been put into SegWit before turning much attention to networking improvements, especially since SegWit will provide a much-desired increase in throughput and may influence the implementation of networking improvements; effectively, Bitcoin Core has decided internally on the following order:  protocol improvements; then networking improvements; then a hard fork. Yet, such an order is not necessarily known to be strictly required; other groups could pick up the slack with the effort to improve networking at the same time. This yields the final, logical ordering:  protocol and networking improvements; then a hard fork. As a bonus, the intervening time between now and a hard fork may allow for observing how the Bitcoin ecosystem responds under some kind of maximum load, thereby revealing greater knowledge about how to improve the system. The real world is the best laboratory, and this experiment is already beginning to run in it. To be explicit, we need to form 3 groups working in parallel:  SegWit Working Group Done. This is already well underway.  IBLT/weak-blocks/thin-blocks Working Group This needs improvement; parameters need to be chosen, game theory needs to be explored, and tests need to be run.  Hard Fork Working Group This needs improvement; all desired protocol cleanups need to be identified and implemented, and the deployment process needs to be finalized, so that everyone knows how it is supposed to unfold. Now, please proceed to find like minds and to form these explicit groups.\n",
      "Science (seemingly) does not (or should not) intend to start from a conclusion, yet there are many proponents of it that clearly do so in what they might refer to as their pursuit for truth. It should not mean to assert a truth and then continually test the security of it. If this is ones approach I fear (with great reason) that self justification of such an asserted truth will cause the individual (or collective) to never step into the realm of possibility of the certain truths falseness. This is what it is meant by “methodological” which is something that is pointed out by John Nash in Ideal Money that we SHOULD or MIGHT adopt for our global financial system, BUT because of our Keynesian beliefs we have not. Our current method of achieving optimal economic efficiency makes the same mistake as the type of peoples described above. Today we try to use inflation targeting to target optimal conditions that might inspire an optimal economic system. This however is NOT the methodological way. Methodological, means we are to ask (not answer!) the question, “What is “OPTIMAL?” in regard to the conditions required for the optimization of our financial system. And so the machines, systems, devices, and policies should not be designed to target some arbitrary definition of optimal… But rather the system itself and its infrastructure should be designed to levate and answer the question of “What is optimal?” It should be no surprise that the average or general person, or a large portion of our society (whether learned or not) has inherited this false doctrine of methodology when our entire system for interaction is based on it.\n",

      "tl;dr - Coinbase closed my account and has blocked all access to my account records that I need to do my taxes. ----- Im one of those people that lost money having their account closed in the middle of a trade and was never given a reason why. Though I can think of several reasons they might have done it. I ran BTC-TC (btct.co) and was fined by the SEC for doing it. I paid my fine, there were never any criminal charges involved, and the shutdown was orderly. I also used btc-e.com quite a bit back in the day. Not that there were many other choices. I have never had a darknet market account, or done anything illegal with my coins. Ultimately, its their right to close my account. But not in the middle of a trade. They had a fiduciary duty as my broker to do what was in my financial best interest. Thats the law. They could have completed the trade, THEN closed the account. Instead, they went to extra effort to back out the trade, costing me an approximate 9% gain as the bitcoin price rose while they had custody of my funds. Now they have not only closed my account, but they are preventing my access to the records I need to meet my legal obligations with my Federal and State taxes. They still allow me to log in, but reject API requests and redirect all requests to coinbase.com/reports to coinbase.com/closed_account. When I closed BTC-TC - a one-man hobby site - I rewrote the code to allow continued access to account records via API and CSV download, and kept the site online well after tax season, at my out-of-pocket expense. How is it that Coinbase, with their millions, cant figure out how to handle this stuff? Why post this publicly? Other than just feeling butt-hurt? (which I am not going to deny...

Ill also add that this is not a case of support not responding. I made my initial request November 24, 2015 and support promptly replied the next day telling me to go to coinbase.com/reports. Problem is that that doesnt work, and theyve been cancelling accounts for years. Plenty of time to hammer out the details.

      "Once again my attempt to summarize and explain the weekly bitcoin developer meeting in laymans terms. [Link to last summarisation]( Disclaimer Please bear in mind Im not a developer so some things might be incorrect or plain wrong. There are no decisions being made in these meetings, but since a fair amount of devs are present its a good representation. Copyright: Public domain  Logs - [link to this week logs]( - [Meeting minutes by meetbot](  Main topics - 0.11 backport release for chainstate obfuscation - C++11 update - EOL Policy / release cycles  Short topics - Recently a configuration option \"-permitrbf\" has been merged, which allows nodes to choose whether to replace opt-in RBF transactions or not. Some discussion ensued to change the default behavior of 0.12.0 and set it to false. As most participants voiced their opinion on the relevant pull-requests ([7386]( & [7388]( this wasnt discussed further in the meeting. - There are some issues being filed concerning database corruptions in bitcoin core. Although the problem hasnt been pinpointed to LevelDB, the long-term plan is still to switch to a new, well maintained database.  0.11 backport release for chainstate obfuscation  background As some windows users might have experienced in the past, anti-virus software regularly detects values in the bitcoin database files which are false-positives. Thereby deleting those files and corrupting the database. To prevent this from happening developers [discussed]( a way to obfuscate the database files and [implemented]( it last year. While downgrading after upgrading is possible, if you start from a new 0.12 installation or youve done a -reindex on 0.12 its impossible to downgrade to 0.11 (without starting from scratch).  meeting comments The proposed [pull-request]( detects the obfuscation in 0.11 so it throws a relevant error message. To avoid this in the future it would be good to have versionnumbers for the chainstate.  meeting conclusion Release a 0.11 backport release right after the 0.12 final release to avoid confusion.  C++11 update  background C++11 is an update of the C++ language. It offers new functionalities, an extended standard library, etc. Zerocash had to be written with some c++11 libraries and some IBLT simulation code was written in c++11, which they want to recycle for the eventual core commit.  meeting comments All changes needed for C++11 have gone in and its ready to switch. Cfields talked to the travis team and all the features needed (trusty, caching) will be ready by the end of the month, so he proposes to wait until then to flip the switch. Wangchung from f2pool indicated he would not run code that required a C++11 compiler. No one knows what his exact concerns are. Wumpus notes the gitian-built executables dont need any special OS support after the C++11 switch.  meeting conclusion Wait for Travis update to switch to C++11. Talk to wangchung about his concerns.  EOL Policy / release cycles  background In general bugfixes, translations and softforks are maintained for 2 major releases. btcdrak proposed to makes this official into a software life-cycle document for bitcoin core in order to inform users what to expect and developers what to code for. [Pull request]( for this document. Given the huge [0.12 changelog]( jonasschnelli asks whether shorter release cycles might be a good idea. Currently theres a +/- 6 month release cycle.  meeting comments Gmaxwell notes he doesnt know how useful the backports are given theres no feedback about them, but thinks the current policy is not bad. \"I am observing the backports appear to be a waste of time. From a matter of principle, I think they are important, but the industry doesnt appear to agree.\" If no one is using the backports, it might not see sufficient testing. People generally agree with the 2 major releases approach. The cyclelength also contributes to frustration and pressure to get features in, as it wont see the light of day for 6 months if it doesnt make the new release.

      "First off, the both titles is stretching the truth a bit. This is tangently related to my BA, and the other part... Im not putting the tl;dr here. Go look at the bottom for that So, lurking around in here, it seems like you guys think Bitcoin could go to the moon, or 1000 USD. That seems like its really far away, considering the [current price is ~399 USD]( Also, it seems like you currently view Bitcoin as a really volatile investment rather than a currency, since you are really happy whenever the price goes up, and kinda shrugs when it goes down. That means we can use normal stock evaluation tools to look at Bitcoin. Thats where my BA project comes in. My project is about pricing options, and a part of that is forecasting stock prices. Im doing that by following the Monte Carlo process outlined in [Wikipedia]( As you can see, we need a volatility and µ. However, µ is defined to be the riskfree interest rate, and over a year, thats currently [0,47%]( The volatility can be read on WolframAlpha, and over the last year, that comes out to [51% over a year]( By pluging all that into the formula on Wikipedia, we get a sample path for the value of Bitcoin. One such path is seen [here]( and another is seen [here]( As you can see, really volatile, just like real life Bitcoin. You could argue that the first is unrealistic, because people might not want to get back into bitcoin once it hits 300, but thats besides the point. So, to get back on track, what I did then was to put in a check to see if my model Bitcoin hit $1000 and then run the simulation 50000 times. The result, when running using 341 days, because thats whats left in the year, was that it hit 1000 in 3512 of them, or 7,024% of them. Not necessarily staying there, mind you. Just hit it. However, if we are a bit less ambitous with our \"moon\" wishes, and say 750 is good enough, we get 9570 hits, or 19,14% of the time. To put those numbers into perspective, 538 puts the odds of [Hillary winning the Iowa election at 82%]( and Kasich winning in New Hampshire at 9%, which means the odds of both happening is 7,38%, better than the odds of Bitcoin hitting 1000. If we stay on the political scene, 538 puts the odds of Bernie winning in Iowa at 18%, which is only slightly worse than the odds of 750 BTC tl;dr: Bitcoin has 7,38% shot at getting to the moon this year\n",

The Banking Industry will do anything to keep the existing system going. ---------------------------------------------------------- EDIT: Thanks for overwhelming support (of the previous post)! In my humble opinion the entire Bitcoin Experiment is under attack. The Banking Industry (the few in charge of it) declared all-out war on this experiment. All means of war are acceptable. Those in charge well understood that Bitcoin Experiment is far beyond the scope of how the material things are controlled. (but we understood it also :) ) If the experiment succeeds, the entire society will move up to the next step on the Maslows pyramid of hierarchical needs. If the experiment fails, we will step down to the world of techno-slavery (regardless of the size of transaction fees). The Soviet Union 2.0 analogy comes to my mind. The outcome of the experiment is the ultimate statement about us - the society. Will the GOOD prevail or will the EVIL succeed?

      "One suggestion Id add is that the channels Bitcoincore.org and the Twitter and slack have some basic rules the holders agree to hold to. Bitcoincore.org was originally purchased for the purpose of being a community asset, this, as well as the Twitter and slack should follow a code of conduct that prevents the types of problems we see now. Right now they are in the names and control of individual people -- this is potentially problematic for the long term as people could die, be injured, be sued, get divorced (and have a domain name seen as an asset), lose interest in Bitcoin or find themselves on the opposite side of an argument with other devs..... Then we end up with another disaster like this where a huge problem is created partly by centralized control of communications. It also concerns me a bit when people refers to \"core\" as if its one monolithic thing, like a company -- sure, right now there is a majority group of the main core devs who agree....but its a bad road to travel to say things like \"core believes X\" or \"core says Y\" this is an open source project and anyone can be a part of core - using the slack, domain and Twitter could imply more consensus buy in than exists or discount minority opinions. /u/btcdrak do you think you and Wladimir could agree to: 1) not ever censor these channels based on opinion. And 2) put in writing that you consider these community assets and they should be governed by multiple people or an impartial organization and wont be sold? Ideally maybe even have a simple committee of 5-7 people who have the power to remove you as admin if they ever voted to. (Hope this is clear I have absolutely no issue with Drak or Wladimir -- I think these channels are great -- I just think they should be future proofed) I think its fair to determine now whether these are viewed as community assets or as personal assets.\n",
      "Over the past week, Core has shown a marked improvement in its communication with the community. Creation of [BitcoinCore.org]( was appropraite. Setting up the [official twitter account]( was smart. Encouraging discussion in [bitcoincore.slack.com]( has been excellent. And most recently, Cores post [here]( was very helpful - well-written and informative. A sincere thank you to Core for demonstrating improvement in this area. Keep it up. Upon this momentum, may I now offer the following humble suggestion: with two more moves, Core can end the civil war. This suggestion is based on discussions with various parties over the past two weeks. Anything less than both is unlikely to settle the issue in any meaningful way. That suggestions are being given to Core, as opposed to Cores opponents, is not an indication that Core is \"primarily at fault\" or that its Cores sole responsibility to fix things. Rather, it is because Core has the power and position to effect meaningful change, in my opinion. Move 1) Core clearly commits to a hard fork block size increase, by adding it to its formal roadmap. The specific plan should probably be the 2-4-8 plan, as proposed initially by [Adam Back]( and which achieved widespread consensus after the scaling conferences. The time to add it to the roadmap is now, and the time to execute the HF should then, within reason, be up to Cores stewardship. This neednt interfere with, and is certainly not a replacement for, the much beloved SegWit. Move 2) Core formally, publicly, and clearly denounces the censorship that has plagued community discussion, and should apologize for not having done so earlier. Core is not responsible for the censorship, but stood silently by as it happened, allowing widespread mistrust to grow out of control. If Core can gather the consensus among its members to take these two steps, and can do so with professionalism, humility, and a sincere desire to move forward and help the community heal, then I believe it will. This would be a victory for the major factions of this divisive issue. We could then all get back to building. There are so many battles ahead to fight against the real enemy. This one, against each other, needs to end. And please, above all, civility in these discussions is paramount. To Core - thank you for the work you have done, and continue to do. I think youll find many allies if you take the above to heart. \n",
      "In order to establish a channel between two parties, one party or both puts funds into a channel, paying a transaction fee. If a party goes inactive, or attempts a fraudulent settlement, the channel must be closed to recover the funds. This also requires the payment of a transaction fee. Suppose the fees go up to $1 per transaction. Then closing a channel means a business needs to pay $1 as a transaction fee to recover their funds. For small transactions, this might be a rather significant sum. Add in the time required to settle (in the case of an inactive channel) a high fee could be a deal breaker. As the fee grows higher, the barrier to entry is just that much harder to scale, so to speak. But this is just the cost to be part of a valuable network, right? Certainly one might make that observation in a few years, but as the Lightning Network is being established, it is not a valuable network. Only a large number of channels creates a valuable network. tl;dr Since the transaction fee is required to build the channel, and to take down the channel, high fees could make deploying Lightning Networks unlikely, and at some level impossible.\n",

      "I’ve been into Bitcoin since early 2011 as a miner, enthusiast and a developer in the industry. I’ve seen all the booms and busts, but I’ve always been able to keep my eyes on the fundamentals, and seen them getting stronger year after year. However, what’s happening now with the Bitcoin Classic’s hard fork proposal, is making me doubt the whole value proposition of Bitcoin. It has absolutely nothing to do with the content of the proposal (having 2MB blocks would be just fine IMO), and everything to do with the fact that it’s seemingly possible to gain industry support for a hard fork, which triggers when only 75% of the miners support it. If this kind of a fork goes through, requiring only a 75% miner majority for a hard fork becomes a thing, and the next time it may not be something as easy to swallow as a small block size increase. In my mind, it would change Bitcoin from something permanent, unchangeable, almost a force of nature, to yet another system, whose properties are up for a majority vote, whenever someone isn’t happy about some aspect of it. Requiring a near unanimous miner support (at least 95%) for a hard fork now, will set a precedent that will protect YOU, when someone with a strong political campaign tries to hard fork Bitcoin into something YOU don’t like. And as Bitcoin gains more and more mainstream acceptance, there’s guaranteed to be more and more people crying to change this or that, with an argument that sounds sensible to your run-of-the-mill CEO. Who’s going to protect your interests then? It all depends on miners and users ability to recognise the dangers of a contested hard fork, now and forever. If I’m unsure about now, how can I be sure about the future? There has to be a lot of people in a similar situation as I am. People who bought into Bitcoin very early on with this idea of “digital gold” (naive or not), who have been sitting at the sidelines, happily holding on to their coins through all the bubbles, and who are now being slowly disillusioned about the whole thing. I know for myself, that if there’s even a hint of a possibility of a contested hard fork happening, I’m not going to be the one left holding the bag.

      "Is this how changes to Bitcoin Core are made?:  a BIP proposal is made somewhere (anywhere in particular?) see note 3  (and/or?) a pull request is made on github  BIP or pull request is either ignored or discussed among developers on IRC  if BIP or pull request has wider appeal and/or controversial aspects it is discussed on forums, and written about on news outlets  if developers reach consensus that the change is desirable, pull request is merged and included in a release of Bitcoin Core (what % of developers must agree to get merge-worthy consensus? how long do developers have to have been around to be part of the consensus....tribunal?). see note 2 below.  Full node operators choose to install new Bitcoin Core release or not.  Changes that are just bug fixes / performance tweaks activate upon installation of new release (?)  Changes that affect network consensus rules require 95% ~~full node acceptance~~ mining hashing power in order to activate (?). This gives ~~full node operators~~ miners the final say in regard to network consensus rule changes see note 1 below note 1 from GibbsSamplePlatter in comments: > Sorta... a full node will still reject any deviations from their protocol. Its nuanced. Full nodes still have a lot of power. Some would argue that exchanges and payment processors have more power than miners in many ways. and note 1 from theymos: > Having miner agreement makes softforks go much more smoothly. In hardforks, miners dont matter. And if miners refuse to go along with a softfork, the same change can always be done with a hardfork instead. Since miners dont matter in a hardfork, hardforks are rolled out by saying \"after <some exact time or block number>, the new rule takes effect\". If the time is sufficiently far in the future and the change is not contentious, everyone should naturally upgrade before then. note 2 from G1lius who has been diligently summarizing core dev meetings: > I think consensus is reached when theres no valid objection, which is different than the change being desirable. You can be totally new to bitcoin development and post a valid objection, and if people dont or cant refute your objection, theres no consensus. and note 2 from curyous with a different view: > The number of developers required to agree for a change to be incorporated varies a lot, sometimes it is very small. If the people with commit access on GitHub think it is a good idea, then it can go in regardless. \"Controversial\" changes are fine if the people in charge want it to happen. I cant find the quote, but Im sure one of the core devs said something like \"consensus does not mean majority\" ie, we can have consensus if only a minority agree. In fact, the amount of consensus required varies so much and is so arbitrary, its like consensus isnt required at all. note 3 from killerstorm > [making a BIP] is not necessary unless you introduce a new feature or a consensus-critical change. You just write code and ask maintainers to merge it (pull request). For backward-compatible changes (soft forks) the \"version bits\" mechanism is recommended now, as it makes forks quite safe. Previously something similar was used. Theres no mechanism for backward-incompatible changes (hard forks), no such changes were introduced so far. It is understood that this can be done if everyone agrees that its a right thing to do. Please let me know if anything is off or missing.\n",

      "Summary Peter Todd recently [posted a description]( of tests he ran to see how easy it is to successfully double-spend bitcoins. Because he was able to execute double spends successfully against a large number of popular wallets using a Python script he wrote, Peter claims to have shown that: >“With the above in mind, deployment of opt-in RBF will have zero effect on users’ vulnerability to double-spends.” Peters tests do not establish this, due to his security model not incorporating the probability of double-spends. The argument Peter sets up his post with: >“A common criticism of Opt-In Replace-by-Fee (RBF) has been that we need to give the ecosystem more time to implement detection of opt-in RBF transactions, arguing that if we don’t users will be put at a significantly greater risk of being ripped off by malicious double-spends. For this criticism to be valid, user and merchant wallets must already be able to detect situations where a transaction may be maliciously double-spent, and warn their users appropriately. On the other hand, if they can’t do that, then opt-in RBF doesn’t change the situation anyway: an attacker doesn’t need to use it anyway to rip people off, and when wallet authors fix that they can trivially add opt-in RBF detection anyway with one or two lines of code.” This analysis ignores how Bitcoin Core’s support of RBF could change the amount of double spending attempts. It matters how likely double spend attempts are before and after RBF, not just whether they both meet some binary threshold of difficulty. Could Core’s support for RBF make double spending easier? Imagine these two scenarios: Scenario 1: A user who wants to double spend must seek out and download a special version of an open source wallet which incorporates the double spending logic in Peter’s Python script. The user must transfer some coins to that wallet address, then use it to double spend. Scenario 2: A user who wants to double-spend needs to open the latest version of the wallet that they’ve always used, then use a UI which allows them to attempt double spends via RBF transactions. It should be clear that attempting a double spend as described in Scenario 2 is easier than in Scenario 1. How do we know that this won’t lead to more double spend attempts? We can all imagine a determined double-spender who would not be deterred by having to go through the process Peter described in his tests. However, it’s possible that many double spends will come from people just trying out some double spending for kicks, who may then do more of it if they succeed. Users who are curious to try double-spending may also be wary of downloading a wallet from an non-trusted source, whereas they wouldn’t worry about using an option in a well-known wallet like Electrum or Mycelium which they already use. Doesn’t this only apply to wallets before they add RBF detection, which is trivial to add? Yes. It is technically pretty easy to add this check. However, as Peter confirmed in his tests, wallets have traditionally not protected themselves very well or quickly against 0-confirmation double spending. It’s unclear how quickly they’ll add RBF detection. If there is a delay between when some mainstream wallets integrate RBF support and when some merchants are checking the RBF flag on transactions, these merchants could see their double-spend losses increase. \n",
      "Look, i supported XT, and then a 2mb increase, (because every agrees that slow confirmation times and large fees are bad), but realized that those werent long term solutions anyway, and far enough from perfect that it makes more sense to just try segwit first-why not?

      "Satoshi noted the price of any commodity tends to gravitate towards the cost of production. This might suggest some predictable and stable value depending on how the factors actually play out over time. Also in regard to the inflation schedule knowing that there is some cost to producing todays supply amount and that amount will half every 4 years, we might expect some increased value based on a similar market demand for what will be less of the commodity produced. Some of this might be offset by advances in energy technology. Bitcoin being a possible candidate for a globally exchangeable money also has a role on the exchange markets. The quality of it (in regard to greshams law) gets judged by the peoples and eventually reflects in the price it seems as well. I think this is where my opinion and understanding be might different from the traditional bitcoin enthusiasts. There is this worry amongst many that we must raise the blocksize and scalability so that user adoption and use can compete with existing systems like Visa. The belief is more adoption will raise the price and create more adoption. Eventually national fiats like the USD will implode and a bitcoin will be worth somewhere in the infinities of USD. But what inflation targeting and money supply controls do is give the possibility that the governments can (and will) adjust to such a change in public favor. In regard to greshams law I think the relevant point is the increased velocity of money that a “bad money” would facilitate because of the introduction of a “good money”. That is to say in one way or another the “bad money” would circulate faster like a hot potato, and the “good money” might then be hoarded especially in relation to the “bad”. I think this might explain the real reason behind the hesitation of merchant adopt: At this point so many customers of the currency are hodlers! As the velocity of the bad money increases and/or the peoples continually attempt to exchange it for a better money, the issuers of national fiat might have no choice but to reign in some of the money supply thus at least temporarily increasing, holding stable, or slowing the decline of, its value. This adjustment then could at least temporarily (but possibly dramatically) effect bitcoins ability to skyrocket in value. Of course it could be argued, if quality of a fiat was equal to bitcoin in the Greshams sense, bitcoin should and would still be the market favourite (for its political impartiality alone!). But even still central banks could enact policies that might be “slightly better” than equal. I guess then there would be the asymptotic effect previously described, which might also be quite observable with any surviving currencies in the near future. As that scenario begins to play itself out towards idealness (money stable in relation to an ideal icpi) there might arise a discussion about how ANY money could be idealized in this sense.\n",

With that in mind Ive created a Bitcoin Core PR and BIP draft that addresses the issue of non-zero value OP_RETURNs in PaymentRequests: [BIP Draft]( [Github PR]( While some of the Core devs are vehemently against any usage of OP_RETURN, some agree that it makes sense to properly support it in the Payment Protocol.

      "Was wondering if I could get a few security pointers - we are currently in the process of opening up a few BATMs on the west coast. Our ATMs support numerous online hosted hotwallets such as blockchain.info, block.io, etc through their APIs. But I was more interested in possible getting a VPS or a dedicated server to run the bitcoind process so that way we have more control over our hotwallet. So a few questions - 1. Is it possible to run bitcoind without downloading the full blockchain? Basically all I will be utilizing is the hotwallet and RPC functionality. I really dont want to run a full node if I dont have to - most VPS providers have pretty small storage capacities unless your paying a lot more money, and with the block chain being almost 60GB in size, that will probably eat up my bandwidth and storage limits real quick. 2. Are there any additional security-best practices that should always be utilized when running a hotwallet in this matter? My plan was to whitelist only our ATM server to be able to utilize RPC calls. I also dont plan on storing more than a few days worth of bitcoin on our hotwallet, the rest will be stored into cold wallets and the HW will be funded as needed. I was also planning on encrypting the server as well, to prevent any intra-host sabotage. 3. Any specific recommendations good hosts?

      "With an ever increasing backlog of transactions nodes will have to boot some transactions from their mempool or face crashing due to low RAM as we saw in previous attacks. Nodes re-relay unconfirmed transactions approximately every 30min. So for every 3 blocks a transaction sits in mempools unconfirmed, its already using double the bandwidth than it would if there were no backlog. Additionally, cores policy is to boot transactions that pay too little fee. These will have to use RBF, which involves broadcasting a brand new transaction that pays higher fee. This will also use double the bandwidth. The way it worked before we had a backlog is transactions are broadcast once and sit in mempool until the next block. Under an increasing backlog scenario, most transactions will have to be broadcast at least twice, if they stay in mempool for more than 3 blocks or if they are booted from mempool and need to be resent with RBF. This uses more bandwidth than if transactions only had to be broadcast once if we had excess block capacity.\n",
      "Its the start of 2016 and miners are rewarded with 25BTC for finding blocks. Adding to this are the transaction fees which vary from 0-1BTC. Later this year the halving will occur and the reward will be reduced to 12.5BTC Lets suppose the transaction volume doesnt increase by any substantial amount and were still using 1MB blocks (even 2MB). Miners will then be looking at a reward of 12.5-13.5 BTC for each block. This obviously makes mining a lot less attractive/profitable, and will more than likely force a lot of miners to stop. Cause + Effect - There will be a period of Hash Power re-balancing. This will more than likely lead to a reduction in Hashing Power of the Bitcoin network, which will consequently be seen as a reduction in Security or Securing Power. Fast forward to the following Halving, which will reduce the Block reward to 6.25. The re-balancing will occur and could again lead to a reduction in Hashing Power of the network. Summary - Correct me if Im wrong, but as we move closer to these Halvings, are we becoming more and more dependent on the price of BTC and transaction volume? Will Bitcoin become vulnerable if neither of these increase? Scenario - If we stayed at the current BTC price and transaction volume for the next 40 years, would this lead to a Bitcoin network that is becoming more and more vulnerable?

      "As far as I can tell the arguments fall under three categories: (1) Because it requires a hard fork, and hard forks are bad because [whatever]; (2) Larger blocks make full nodes more expensive to operate, which is bad because [whatever]; and (3) Larger blocks mean lower transaction fees, which is bad because [whatever]. Regarding 3, my only response here is that I disagree that lowering transaction fees would be bad. I dont expect that that there will ever be a consensus on that, as it requires predicting what would happen in the future, so thats all Id really like to say about that in this thread. Regarding 1: The block size can be increased without a hard fork. This can be done in many ways, one of which is similar to the way SegWit is being implemented (anyone-can-spend transactions plus a merkle root hash in the coinbase transaction). There are good arguments that it shouldnt be done this way, but these are the same arguments for why SegWit shouldnt be done as a soft fork. Regarding 2: SegWit also makes full nodes more expensive to operate. What Id like to ask here is whether or not anyone can think of any other categories, and whether or not anyone can think of a reason why SegWit is somehow less risky than increasing the block size to 2MB under argument 1 or 2.\n",

      "There is a number of alternative Bitcoin implementations not based on Bitcoin Core. Heres a list of ones which are best-know, best-tested, and, possibly, are ready for production:  [bitcoinj]( is a Java library; it doesnt aim to be a full node, but it has pretty much all the code you need for a full node  [btcd]( is a full node implemented in Go (a relatively new language from Google, designed specifically for network servers). It is known for high test coverage, [perhaps more complete than Bitcoin Core](  [haskcoin]( is a Bitcoin full node implemented in Haskell, a pure functional programming language.  [libbitcoin]( is a complete reimplementation of Bitcoin in C++ started by Amir Taaki. It is supposed power Dark Wallet, and, possibly, Electrum in future (via obelisk) Why are these projects important? They can be used to test Bitcoin Core itself, validate our understanding of the Bitcoin protocol and improve security. Software monoculture is dangerous. A vulnerability in Bitcoin Core might affect a large number of nodes and businesses which rely on them. A business can protect itself by cross-checking transactions against implementations not based on Bitcoin Core, as they are highly unlikely to have exactly the same set of vulnerabilities. Implementation based on type-safe languages (Go, Java, Haskell) are particularly interesting because they eliminate a large set of vulnerabilities. Perhaps one day we can make one of these type safe implementation the reference implementation. And formal verification (which is more feasible for languages like Haskell) can be used to make sure that implementation matches the specification... ...But none of this matters to Gavin Andresen. In his [recent blog post about alternative implementations]( he didnt mentioned none of the actual alternative implementations! He only mentioned Classic, Unlimited and XT which are 99.99% same as Bitcoin Core. _Meet the new boss. 99.99% same as the old boss._ OK, perhaps he didnt mention, say, btcd because hes afraid of some subtle consensus difference which can cause network fork, that might be really dangerous... Well, hello, Classic, Unlimited and XT are specifically designed to cause a network fork! Lets stop pretending. Gavins post is just a thinly veiled hard fork propaganda. He doesnt care even a bit about things hes mentioned -- diversity, multiple development teams, development cultures. Otherwise he would have mentioned btcd, haskcoin, libbitcoin, which actually introduce diversity (implemented in a different language), new development teams, etc. We \"didn’t have the resources to support multiple development teams\"? Well apparently we had several teams to rewrite Bitcoin code completely from scratch. You didnt notice that? At this point Ive lost all respect for /u/gavinandresen. I disagreed with his earlier post, but I wanted to give him a benefit of doubt, as he successfully led the project for years. Now he resorts to cheap propaganda, this is just despicable. EDIT: I find it interesting that this post got ~8 points at 75% approval, but then quickly got to 0 points at ~50% approval. Chances of this happening without brigading are very small.\n",

      "I recently read that China is going to start their own digital currency, which led me to some really bad thoughts. Imagine the following scenario: The Chinese government decides to put the whole bitcoin industry of China, all hardware supplier, the big trading platforms and all mining pool under goverment control. Complete nationalization. (That could have different reasons, which I dont want to discuss here, but please keep in mind that I life as an expat in China and know that the govermentment could do that at any time. They already have an eye on bitcoin for a long time.) So already with the hardware supplier they control in fact most of the decentralisation effort of the hardware industry. Then they took the worlds biggest 3 Pools (f2pool, antpool and btcpool - all in China and extremly centralized) and control in a surprise 60% of the whole bitcoin network. So much about 51% attack - you can not withdraw 10% of the worldwide mining power from them, because they already control the hardware supplier. So they could compensate some free miners leaving the three pools easily with new hardware. That would be some kind of \"Blitzkrieg\", or? It would not be a small growing danger, which can easily fought back. Governments and banks (the whole financial establishment) had no reason to help, because bitcoin is already a competitor to them. China could do with bitcoin whatever they want: Reject transactions, overrule everything, destroy the whole network... Also then they control the trading and with the big Chinese platforms (OKCoin, btcchina and so on) 80% (!) of the whole bitcoin market. What no goverment could do in the past China can do: extinct Botcoin and wipe it from the planet! I hope they are never aware of that option, but I I think they already are! \n",

      "For a moment, entertain the opinion that Bitcoins architecture should be divided into layers, with \"Bitcoin\" (as we know it today) being the base layer. Most of you probably already have. As a simple reference, this would be analogous to the architecture of the Internet, in many respects. That foundation layer allows for \"smart contracts\", contracts that are deterministic in nature, enforced in code, and backed by the networks growing hashing power. In the real world, contracts are enforced in a court of law, backed by physical force (ultimately, a nations military). On the Internet, value moves seamlessly and contracts, specifically smart contracts, are enforced by code. And code, unlike natural language, can encapsulate absolutes. Its deterministic and incorruptible (unlike humans), when properly engineered and deployed. In the physical, everyday world, contracts are rarely enforced. You sign contracts every day. Why are contracts rarely ]taken to a court of law? Because the judicial system isnt free (very far from it) and the parties involved know the evidence, should it exist, could be enforced, if one party attempts to break the agreement. A certain trust exists in the judicial system and, more generally, in the government. On the Internet, there are no nation borders, and smart contracts also rarely need be enforced. Like in the physical world, nodes on this network can transact with each other and exchanging value without having to enforce every transfer. Enforcing transfers costs money (\"bitcoins\"), just like going to court costs money. All that is really required in the system is the faith that one could enforce the transfer if the other party breaks the agreement. An example of this would be if the receiving party claimed he never received a transfer, when if fact he did. In both cases, the integrity and harmony of the judicial system is the utmost important. WIthout a solid, well-funded foundation, the entire system fails. But with that proper foundation, incredible things can be built. \n",

      "The expression money is power is incorrect: Electricity is priced in kilowatt•hours, so the units of money are interchangeable with the units of power•time Physics tells us power = energy ÷ time, so money is like (energy ÷ time)•time… Money is like Energy! (In Canada, a kiloWatt of electric energy costs about 0.00015 BTC.) But energy and money are not the same thing! We know a few things about energy: The law of conservation says energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it merely transforms. Nuclear, chemical, kinetic, electrical, gravitational, magnetic, and heat are just different forms energy can take. Heat is an important form because its always increasing as the universe grows older. Energy moves from the sun to grass; from grass to cows; and cows to humans; from oil in the ground to moving cars; from water in a dam to electrons in a wire; from electrons in a wire to heat in the air rushing past a computer chip mining bitcoin. But this last transformation is strange, because something else happens: money is created... and as weve seen, money is like energy. So whats going on? Is bitcoin mining converting electrical energy only partially into heat, and partially into some kind of \"money energy\"?\n",
      "This morning I awoke to a post from /u/nullc describing how Bitcoin is dissimilar to a centralized payment network (hes right about that). Bitcoin is not Visa, even with 1GB blocks. The analogy is made to a rocket ship with multiple stages, or layers. Each layer is important, and not all features or functions can be squished down into one layer. I am not an engineer, but I understand and respect this principle. I dont believe the base Bitcoin protocol can (or should try) to handle Visa throughput. Bitcoin is built to be the foundation of a decentralized financial system, not a high-capacity payment network. /u/nullc is correct about this. And sure, Bitcoin can be appropriately thought of as a rocket, bound for the moon. We need brilliant engineers to build it. It takes a long time, the stakes are high, and design shouldnt be left to the crowd. Multiple stages and layers are needed, absolutely. Id like to consider another analogy, not of Bitcoin as a machine/rocket, but of the community which supports and builds it... Lets imagine a desert island, with a crowd of survivors from some shipwreck or airplane crash (think of the opening scene from Lost). We, the Bitcoin community, are perhaps like that crowd. To get off the island, to succeed, well need to build a boat (or a rocket?). Well need to work together. We have different skills, perspectives, and certainly different temperaments. Few of us knew each other before we arrived here, yet we find ourselves in close quarters, all with the shared vision of escape and all slightly terrified of failing. And there is so much work to be done. Consider that, even to survive for a while while we build our escape vessel, some prerequisite activities must be pursued. Food must be found. Water. Shelter. We must tend to the wounded. Well need to seek out and collect raw resources, and form teams for construction. We disavow monarchs, so we must nurture social consensus and decentralized judgement. Now, consider in the early days of this scenario, there might be significant controversy. Perhaps there is heavy disagreement on whether we should secure a source of clean water, or build shelter first. Maybe a violent storm is coming. A well can be dug, but only with the majority helping. A shelter can be built, but again only with the majoritys effort. At first, those who believe water is most important (call them TeamWater) and those who believe shelter is most important (call them TeamShelter) debate over the merits of each. They engage in civil debate, they are polite. They try to convince the other of the preeminence of their project. Unfortunately, neither is able to convince the other. Soon, bickering, squabbling, distrust of one another takes over from the previously rational conversation. Each team thinks the other must have bad motives, for how could they be so blind? Obviously, water is needed first. Obviously, shelter before the storm is paramount. Who sent these guys? Who do they work for? Why are they trying to sabotage us? They must be either idiots, or intentionally trying to destroy our chances of survival. They are not like us. They are the enemy. We are so vastly different, we must fight and diminish them. Factions form, and become entrenched. Soon, the groups arent even talking with each other. Meanwhile, thirst grows, while the storm draws nearer. TeamWater, knowing itself to be correct, proceeds to dig the well. But they keep getting distracted. Shouts from TeamShelter are incessant. Several of TeamWaters best engineers spend half their time trying to keep TeamShelter from interfering with them. Whenever TeamShelter brings up their concern, which has been repeated so often, they are told, \"Look, water is essential for life. If we dont have water, we will all die, and the storm wont matter. Let us dig this well.\" TeamShelter accuses them of elitism, of not paying attention to the looming storm. \"Look how many people think shelter is important! The storm is almost here!\" Then, one of TeamShelter freaks out, writes a blog post, dismissing the entire effort, saying it has failed, and runs into the ocean never to be seen again. Things turn darker. The incident frightens some from TeamShelter. They genuinely worry that if TeamWater maintains its stubborn hold on the group, everyone may indeed be doomed. Several people huddle together, and decide theyre going to go off and find shelter on their own. They are going to split the group. Its contentious. \"You fools!\" says TeamWater, \"Dont you know how dangerous that is? Who knows what is out in that forest, there could be monsters. We would all need to go together, and it needs careful planning.\" \"Okay, then.\" TeamShelter says, \"Will you promise to come with us to gather materials for shelter after the well is done?\" Silence. \"Will you guys help us build the shelter after the water is finished?\" Silence. \"Hello?!\" \"This is not a democracy,\" TeamWater says, \"We will not be swayed by public opinion. We are engineers, and we think the well is important, so we will continue building it. Gathering materials for shelter is very risky.\" \"Well okay, but we WILL build shelter, right?\" TeamShelter asks. \"Weve calculated that water is most important, so thats what were doing.\" TeamWater counters. \"Okay, and then after that, shelter?\" \"Getting the shelter will be risky. Right now, we need water.\" TeamWater reminds them. Insults fly. Tempers flare. \"Guys, were talking past each other and it isnt very productive. We just need to know that, after the well, we can expect to go get some shelter. We know the shelter wont be permanent. We know it wont solve all our problems. We know it wont make us as efficient as Visa. We know there are risks out to there in obtaining it. We know water is important, too, but when the $% are we getting shelter?\" \"Water is most important, please stop bothering us. We are engineers.\" And both groups huddle down in their sandy trenches. Thirsty, cold, and angry with each other. The well proceeds slowly, subject to constant heckling and distraction. TeamWater, while correct in its assessment of the importance of water, has been myopic. Focused on building the well, and confident in its engineering acumen, it has ignored, to the peril of everyone, the importance of simple social cohesion. \"We shouldnt have to be babysitters. We are not a PR company. Its not our fault if the masses cant understand the importance of the well,\" they say. It is, as so common with human enterprise, an instance of missing the forest for the trees. Such benefit could be had, at such minimal cost, by simply looking up, recognizing the genuine worry and desire of the group for shelter, and waylaying their concerns. \"Yes, we know shelter is important,\" TeamWater could so easily say, \"Your fear of the impending storm is valid. Help us with this well, and well then join you in the search for shelter. Its dangerous, so we need to be thoughtful, but we want shelter too and well get to it once this well is ready. Lets help each other.\" Yes, lets help each other. Is that such an alien request? Is that so far out of the scope of an engineers plans? All that is required is a little humility, a little empathy, and indeed something that all engineers should have natively, a little reason... for a rocket ship is unlikely to ever be built if its team sits in disarray, unwilling to seize such considerable social benefit at such mere cost. \n",

      "A lot of people on Reddit think of Bitcoin primarily as a competitor to card payment networks. I think this is more than a little odd-- Bitcoin is a digital _currency_. Visa and the US dollar are not usually considered competitors, Mastercard and gold coins are not usually considered competitors. Bitcoin isnt a front end for something that provides credit, etc. Never the less, some are mostly interested in Bitcoin for payments ([not a new phenomenon]( and are not so concerned about what are, in my view, Bitcoins primary distinguishing values-- monetary sovereignty, censorship resistance, trust cost minimization, international accessibility/borderless operation, etc. (Or other areas we need to improve, like personal and commercial privacy) Instead some are very concerned about Bitcoins competitive properties compared to legacy payment networks. ... And although consumer payments are only one small part of whole global space of money, ... money gains value from network effects, and so I would want all the \"payments only\" fans to love Bitcoin too, even if I didnt care about payments. But what does it mean to be seriously competitive in that space? The existing payments solutions have huge deployed infrastructure and merchant adoption-- lets ignore that. What about capacity? Combined the major card networks are now doing something on the other of 5000 transactions per second on a year round average; and likely something on the order of 120,000 transactions per second on peak days. The decentralized Bitcoin blockchain is globally shared broadcast medium-- probably the most insanely inefficient mode of communication ever devised by man. Yet, considering that, it has some impressive capacity. But relative to highly efficient non-decentralized networks, not so much. The issue is that in the basic Bitcoin system every node takes on the whole load of the system, that is how it achieves its monetary sovereignty, censorship resistance, trust cost minimization, etc. Adding nodes increases costs, but not capacity. Even the most ~~reckless~~ hopeful blocksize growth numbers dont come anywhere close to matching those TPS figures. And even if they did, card processing rates are rapidly increasing, especially as the developing world is brought into them-- a few more years of growth would have their traffic levels vastly beyond the Bitcoin figures again. No amount of spin, inaccurately comparing a global broadcast consensus system to loading a webpage changes any of this. So-- Does that mean that Bitcoin cant be a big winner as a payments technology? No. But to reach the kind of capacity required to serve the payments needs of the world we must work more intelligently. From its very beginning Bitcoin was design to incorporate layers in secure ways through its smart contracting capability (What, do you think that was just put there so people could wax-philosophic about meaningless \"DAOs\"?). In effect we will use the Bitcoin system as a highly accessible and perfectly trustworthy robotic judge and conduct most of our business outside of the court room-- but transact in such a way that if something goes wrong we have all the evidence and established agreements so we can be confident that the robotic court will make it right. (Geek sidebar: If this seems impossible, go read this old post on [transaction cut-through]( This is possible precisely because of the core properties of Bitcoin. A censorable or reversible base system is not very suitable to build powerful upper layer transaction processing on top of... and if the underlying asset isnt sound, there is little point in transacting with it at all. The science around Bitcoin is new and we dont know exactly where the breaking points are-- I hope we never discover them for sure-- we do know that at the current load levels the decentralization of the system has not improved as the users base has grown (and appear to have reduced substantially: even businesses are largely relying on third party processing for all their transactions; something we didnt expect early on). There are many ways of layering Bitcoin, with varying levels of security, ease of implementation, capacity, etc. Ranging from the strongest-- bidirectional payment channels (often discussed as the lightning system), which provide nearly equal security and anti-censorship while also adding instantaneous payments and improved privacy-- to the simplest, using centralized payment processors, which I believe are (in spite of my reflexive distaste for all things centralized) a perfectly reasonable thing to do for low value transactions, and can be highly cost efficient. Many of these approaches are competing with each other, and from that we gain a vibrant ecosystem with the strongest features. Growing by layers is the gold standard for technological innovation. Its how we build our understanding of mathematics and the physical sciences, its how we build our communications protocols and networks... Not to mention payment networks. Thus far a [multi-staged]( approach has been an integral part of the [design of rockets]( which have, [from time to time]( brought mankind to the moon. Bitcoin does many unprecedented things, but this doesnt release it from physical reality or from the existence of engineering trade-offs. It is not acceptable, in the mad dash to fulfill a particular application set, to turn our backs on the fundamentals that make the Bitcoin currency valuable to begin with-- especially not when established forms in engineering already tell us the path to have our cake and eat it too-- harmoniously satisfying all the demands. Before and beyond the layers, there are other things being done to improve capacity-- e.g. Bitcoin Cores [capacity plan]( from December (see also: the [FAQ]( proposes some new improvements and inventions to nearly double the systems capacity while offsetting many of the costs and risks, in a fully backwards compatible way. ... but, at least for those who are focused on payments, no amount of simple changes really makes a difference; not in the way layered engineering does. \n",

      "Can we make the assumption that we all long for truth? That we all might crave it, or move to it, or adore it if we could know exactly which content is “true”? Do we know the direction of infallible logic? Do we know what is false doctrine so we might avoid it? Can these things be sorted out with reason? I think perhaps we sometimes make the mistake of believing that science levates an objective truth, and that by being blindly peer reviewed, the minimized bias creates a likelihood of truth that is so unrivaled we call it the ultimate objective. I am not so sure. We inherit this belief perhaps from our democracies or some other inherited belief system that the majority must rule (rather than perhaps simply (today) the majority does rule) in regard to what is socially acceptable or deemed “truth” (obviously worse would be if an elite minority ruled). Its easy to see and say one might not want to argue with “social rule” in regard to say a stop light, or a police officer that wants to pull you over for running it, however I think we should not try to extrapolate a corollary that suggest that social rule is the most objective or “truthful” (or scientifically accurate!). So here I think I have levated a question, that creates a division which I think might be “socially” useful, “Is there an objective truth?” Firstly we can note that we have broken from the notion that society is the provider of the objective truth, since it should be quite easy to show that at least in the past, society has been the proponent of very subjective truth (perhaps such as the world is flat etc.). Science claims to be on the pursuit of this, but again it is subject to the whims of social order regardless of its rigorous method and system. Yet if we can imagine some possible objective truth, perhaps only what god (that might not exist) would know, we might then see this process as a game in which the ultimate strategy is found based on the ultimate objective truth. Balance then in some sense could be said to be optimal in this regard, but the search, pursuit, and application of balance would of course be futile without a center point (like targeting a corruptible metric!). \n",

      "Since there will only be 21 million coins and the userbase is probably only gonna grow one BTC will potentially become pretty expensive, and in the future (if we assumed Bitcoin becomes a widely used global currency) nobody will actually spend \"coins\" to buy something but rather small pieces of a coin. This is of course not a mathematical problem since you can divide BTC into smaller pieces but its more of a psychological problem. The general person is not used to a single coin being so valuable and dividable at the same time. A lot of people who dont quite understand how Bitcoin works look at the charts and conclude that 1 BTC is way too expensive and they dont want to invest in that. At the same time 0.08 BTC looks like a pathetic amount to own even though its not. The problem right now of course being that mBTC just sounds like a tiny part of the real thing and nobody wants to own some \"milli Bitcoin\". However because Bitcoin is so dividable you could fix this problem easily by shifting units. What we call 1 mBTC could then be called 1 BTC and what was previously 1 BTC would then be 1 kiloBitcoin (kBTC). So if you owned 2 Bitcoin, you would now have 2000 Bitcoins, however in the grand scheme it doesnt matter because its just a change of name, it applies to everyone, nothing actually changes within the economy. The price charts just would have to change BTC to kBTC. This is just an idea to turn Bitcoin from seeming more like a commodity to something that seems more like a digital \"coin\".\n",

      "Ive been working on the following BIP and Im looking for your suggestions and remarks. Abstract: - The maximum block size (miners can create) is raised to 32MB. - Nodes can specify the maximum block size they’ll relay. It can’t be lower than 1MB and the value is publicly announced. - Miners navigate between the risk of being orphaned and losing on transaction fees. - 95% Activation threshold. Motivation: Miners are motivated by the bitcoin they mine on each block. The revenue is split between block coinbase reward and transaction fees. Greed will push miners to increase the size of the blocks to make more on transaction fees. Fear of the blocks not propagating fast enough will prevent miners from creating blocks that are too big. The maximum relay value of each node is public. Miners have the duty of researching and analysing the network of bitcoin nodes. They have to determine the right block size to minimise orphan risk and increase profitability. Specification: - The maximum block size is set to 32MB. - The minimum relay value is 1MB. The maximum is 32MB. - The bitcoin client can automatically determine and adjust the relay value based on the host bandwidth capacity. - The operator can set the relay value to a fixed amount, but not lower than 1MB. - The relay value is publicly advertised to other nodes. Rationale: = Chinese miners Most nodes are located in the western world. Most of the hashing power is located in China. It’s possible that a 32MB block that is generated in France, for example, gets propagated quickly through the western world (most of the nodes). However, Chinese miners won’t be able to download and relay this block. So they’ll mine on another chain with smaller blocks. The network will eventually fork. But the western nodes will adjust again to the chain which has the most proof of work. This can be a possible attack surface on the network. Nodes can mitigate against this attack by lowering their relay value below their hardware capacity to adjust for the Chinese miners. = Insights into the network capacity By making the relay value public, economic operators and miners have a valuable insight into the network capacity. Miners will decide the size of blocks they create based on this data. There will be less conflict (and arguing) on how much the network can support. = The maximum throughput of the network This proposal assumes the Segregated Witnesses Soft-fork is deployed. The maximum number of transaction the network could handle would be around 20 million transactions per day. (assuming widespread use of Segregated Witnesses in the future). A 32MB maximum size will give much more leeway than a single 2MB increase. = Resolving the block size conflict - Nodes will be able to cast their vote and determine the network capacity. There will be less speculation on how much the network can support. - Nodes will, voluntarily, compromise for China lack of bandwidth to stay on the chain with the most proof of work. - Instead of working on multiple implementation, software developers will work on a single implementation and leave the upgrade decision to the network.\n",
      "The strategic move here is simple, and it pretty much prevents any other implementation from dethroning Core for the foreseeable future. As an example, heres how Core can make sure Classic can never gain a foothold: 1) Counsel an exchange like Bitfinex to set up [fork-futures trading]( for Classics proposed fork, where investors can buy and sell future coins (call options) on the Core side vs. coins on the Classic side. The trading would commence well in advance of the proposed fork. 2a) As long as Core is winning in the trading, do nothing. Cores position is safe. 2b) If Classic is winning, simply announce that Core will raise the blocksize limit to 2MB in 3 months. Classic will lose and again Core is safe. Note that this could even be refined further: if Core wants to wait a year for a blocksize increase, it could announce that instead and check how the futures market reacts. If Core pulls well ahead on that announcement, Core could rest assured that they can stay more in line with their preferred roadmap without risking their dominant position. (You might say, \"What if things change during the year and people again itch for a fork?\" Then futures trading would start anew, and Core could reassess in the same way, always maintaining its leading position with minimum compromise.) Alternatively, if that announcement is not enough to pull ahead in futures trading, Core could change it to 9 months or 6 months, testing the markets reaction each time. Result: Core makes the absolute minimal changes necessary to retain its position. It doesnt risk overreaching and losing its reference implementation status, and it doesnt under-reach by compromising on its vision too much in an effort to please the market. All because it has the best tool available for ascertaining the markets reaction in advance - a futures market.\n",
      "Im not trying to raise an argument, just trying to stay informed. From all angles segwit looks like a fantastic solution to a controversial problem. If so, what are the opponents debate points? Is it just that its not enough? Or is it a stubborn \"No! We want 2MB right meow!\" kind of deal? Edit: THANK YOU ALL for your information on this topic. I understand the technical aspects behind it all (being a network security manager), its the politics that always irk me. And now I also understand IBLN. If i were inclined enough Id push to be a developer, but my current place of work/life wont allow me to devote time to it until about a year from now. I agree with Eriks statement below: \"SegWit is the right decision. So is a hf to a conservative larger blocksize. I dont really care which is done first, and am happy to follow Cores leadership, but they should commit to both. They are not mutually exclusive.\" Edit: will make a follow-up post based on what Ive learned here about the arguments from all sides. Again, thank you for all of the information minus the person to person attacks. I didnt need a heated argument, but I dont mind a spirited debate. Edit: From what it seems is that on the large part SW is agreed upon by everybody. The major opponents are those who still want their hard fork to 2MB now because they think SW will prevent that (even though thats part of cores way ahead). There are those that think that core is just using this as a too little too late fix for not increasing the size earlier. Also coupled with those who are afraid that a 2MB increase could cause a DOS against those miners. Also, the security issue from those who dont immediately upgrade. Those arguments that are due to pitting us against Visa I believe are irrelevant, but only due to time. At a later date those will then become valid. \n",
      "Ive recently purchased Ledger and Trezor wallets for signing a multi-signature wallet. Both companies strongly recommend to store recovery seeds on paper.

      "Questions and Answers about Bitcoin from both Core and Classic perspectives.  Who makes Bitcoin? Bitcoin is an open source project so anyone can use it and modify it but it has a group of developers who are dedicated to improving it  Classic Answer Currently there are five developers however there are zero current developers who will lead the project in day to day programming in the long term or are working on any significant new features. This is hoped to be improved in the future. Big companies such as mining operations and fiat exchanges and in the future node operation companies decide what Bitcoin is, with the help of market research to determine what people want Bitcoin to be.  Core Answer Currently there are well over a hundred contributors to the project, many new features are in progress and there is a generally accepted roadmap for future features that the developers are happy to commit to. In the last year, 45 different people directly contributed to the codebase. Development on the system is open to companies who want to contribute, or anyone as long as they can work with others and produce results that everyone can see are helping accomplish the basic use cases of Bitcoin  What Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a new kind of money that is designed to be used by anyone in the world via the Internet.  Classic Answer Bitcoin is something that can be used to sync money and all sorts of information in a global database. We dont know if that can be cheap for the long term but we will try and extend that concept using currency inflation and expanded supply of space for sale for as long as possible. Its difficult and expensive to control your own money fully but you can choose from some providers who help you control it which should hopefully keep it pretty accessible for most people. The tradeoff for that convenience is that those people who help you use Bitcoin get to represent you when making changes to Bitcoin, although you can always just stop using Bitcoin.  Core Answer Bitcoin is a stable and reliable currency ledger that makes a limited set of promises and avoids risking peoples money through as strong as possible security guarantees. You can fairly easily control your own money completely, others can stop using Bitcoin of course but no one can possibly redefine the strong starting guarantees guaranteed to you without your explicit consent.  When should the world use Bitcoin? The world could use Bitcoin today, but it wouldnt be the same going forward because as more and more people used it, it would need to change its character in some respects.  Classic Answer If Bitcoin is used by everyone right away what will happen is that it will work as it does today, but running the servers that power Bitcoin will become more and more expensive. It will be similar to email: everyone will just look at some ads and let a company mine their data a bit in exchange for access to the Bitcoin network and sacrifice of control of how it works. It will still be possible for an individual to run their own server, but over time it will be pretty impractical and difficult to do it anonymously or in a way that cant be easily shut down by a powerful attacker.  Core Answer If Bitcoin is used by people right away, the network will become expensive to transact on directly but it will remain cheap to be a peer to peer node with no outside dependencies, practically anyone will be able to do it without major expense. Since the node will remain cheap and have a low footprint, it will be difficult to attack and easy to use fairly anonymously. As the network becomes expensive to transact on this will create a market opportunity that provides alternatives to the network, limiting the growth of network expense and providing a range of cheaper or more convenient alternatives.  Why should people use Bitcoin? People should use Bitcoin to hold currency and send each other money over the Internet  Classic Answer Bitcoin should be used as a permissionless alternative to PayPal and other money transmission services. Businesses can set up money transmission businesses without quite as much legal hassle and people can use a low cost way to send money or other long term stored information to each other in ad hoc ways. Businesses decide all the rules of Bitcoin, but they are motivated by profitability to make sure these rules still sound attractive to users.  Core Answer Bitcoin should be used as a worldwide standard basis for currency to act as a federal reserve or gold standard or European Central Bank. People can then keep their money in Bitcoin with the assurance of gold that it will retain its limited nature as well as fungibility and other essential properties, but with the convenience and flexibility of modern digital fiat currencies. Sending money to people can be done over the network itself or via various competing centralized and decentralized systems that interface with Bitcoin and depend on it as a stable foundation and use it as a unit of account.  Where is the Bitcoin stored and processed? Bitcoin is principally stored on the Blockchain that is essentially a ledger file that is synced around the world. Some Bitcoin are held in custody for people in various ways, still on the Blockchain but held by a proxy mechanism.  Classic Answer The Blockchain is a huge file that lives in a bunch of data centers around the world. People can still retain an element of control via holding their own private keys, but they depend on these data center operators to accept, store and process transactions. These operators are also the ones who are relied upon to check that the rules of the system are being followed, and thus they also decide those rules.  Core Answer The Blockchain is a small file that lives on individuals computers all around the world. Anyone and everyone can act as a full peer, so everyone can check that the rules of the system are being followed and thus everyone can participate in deciding the rules by deciding all the rules for themselves. \n",

      "Before the storm I would like to say a few things. Because this level of play seems to involve interactions where things can be taken away we have defense mechanisms. One of those being the sense of trust. Do we trust Classic and their intentions? In such a playing field we develop practices based on agreement or disagreement with various groupings based upon whether we feel they will help or harm us. We also have attribution processes working in our minds. Mental models that we create that affect the way we perceive what we hold a model for. We tend to summarize and conclude, take sides and assume. So if you would like to take a binary stance with me thats fine but I would like to say that there are things that we share. And there are certain things we share in desire for. Such as being happy and raising a family in peace. Or being free to explore any direction. These desires are shared even by groups of opposing teams. Many times the comforts of those things are missing only because the groups use their time to oppose one another. So before the storm I would like to say that I share in the desire for peace. Although you may be one who disagrees with my approach to finding that I ask you to remember that we could very well be searching for the same things but using different approaches. Together we may be able to get there much faster. However, there is still camaraderie in the concept of enemy. For this provides experience and growth of its own.

      "Im currently working with a couple of AI / machine learning PhDs, were currently adapting their models to the crypto markets. These markets seem to be young and fairly inefficient, one model were focusing on is producing very interesting backtesting results. [For anyone thats interested]( The model in question is based on recurrent neural networks and hawkes processes, the premise of it is to take TA indicators then use ML model to auto weight the importance of these indicators to accurately predict the direction of the price into the future. It continuously learns over time and updates its parameters given changing market condition Currently were using TA-lib, a python library of 150 TA indicators as the models inputs. Currently it seems to be quite good at investing at early stages of pumps, however its very poor at predicting price reversals ie knowing when sell. Obviously this isnt something trivial, events such as dumps can be completely random. We want to improve the models performance and optimize it to act more efficiently in these markets. One way to do this is to use custom indicators that have been designed to work with specifically with these markets. Which gets me to the topic of this post. It seems the loan rates on poloniex are much higher for coins before they dump, although they are high at other times as well, by making an indicator from: a. the LoanOffer rates b. the amount of active loans We could feed this into the model to determine if it can find any patterns between how these metrics change with what the price does. Has anyone had any experience with this ? Im trying to figure out how the indicator would be programmed. Currently im thinking making an oscillator going from the minimum interest rate to the max ( 5% / day on polo). The rate of loans being taken and the amount of loans currently out for loan could also be used in another indicator somehow This is just one idea I had, if anyone has written other custom indicators they use in these markets and are interested in what were doing, please feel free to drop me a pm.

      "Some pools have announced their intention to use Bitcoin Classic (e.g., Slush ). If enough of the hashing capacity joins such that 75% of the recent blocks (i.e., last 1,000 blocks) have block header showing nVersion=0x30000000 then it activates (allowing a hard fork to occur 28 days later). Which pools can miners use that will not be marking blocks with nVersion=0x30000000 so as to help keep support under 75% which would keep a Bitcoin Classic hard fork from occurring? [Edited: apparently Bitcoin Classic uses block header/scriptsig of nVersion=0x30000000].\n",

      "Disclaimer : the following scenario is only speculation: 1) On the way of triggering, as an increased hashrate % commits to Classic, investors will become concerned and will prefer to hold fiat rather than bitcoins and wait for the turmoil to pass away. 2) Bitcoin price will drop, possibly down to $200-300 3) Miners will be forced out of the network, losing too much money: Hashrate will drop, and consequently, finding blocks will take longer, and blocks will be full. 4) Once the 75% is reach (or whatever the theshold will be), Core will have to ask itself what to do. 5) More and more vocal users will find unacceptable that miners can enforce changes that have received widespread technical criticism. 6) 50-65% of full nodes wont be switching to classic. 7) Core declares : \"If the consensus rules can be changed by populist tactics and lobbying against the technical communities recommendations, than Bitcoin is a failed project, Core wont be implementing the 2MB HF\". 8) During the grace period, more and more vocal users ask for a PoW reset. 9) Core declares it is ready to merge a PoW reset to Keccak, to free Bitcoin from politics and populism. 10) Bitcoin.org ; Bitcoin.it ; r/bitcoin annonce they will be supporting the PoW reset and see it as the only true Bitcoin. 11) The mining community is outraged, shocked and terrified. Some of them switch back to Core 12.0 12) Investors are also terrified by the idea of a durable split, Bitcoin price between $100-200. More miners are pushed out of the network. 13) Satoshi Nakamoto resurfaces and declares Bitcoin a failed project. He declares he supports the technical community and will destroy Classic with his stake. 14) Miners now have all switched back to Core. 15) Core steps back from merging Keccak after having the major mining pools commit to never attempting a power grab again. 16) The community is now back on tracks to fully implement segwit and the technical communities roadmap. 17) The conflict being resolved, investors jump back on board and Bitcoin is back on the tracks of success. 18) Lesson learned :  miners trying to enforce new consensus rules outside of technical consensus have everything to lose.  Miners cant be both : the ones who decides the rules and the ones that enforce them ; miners only mould the present and solidify the past (citation from /u/yogurt ?).  The community now understands better why controversial hardforks are undesirable, dangerous and why everyone who has stake in Bitcoin is incentivized to move away from them. \n",

      "I noticed that it says: \"which allows it to maintain a wallet and send/receive transactions without needing a local copy of Bitcoin Core.\" on their Github: I presume this means that you dont have to have the blockchain locally to perform transactions on the Bitcoin network when using Bitcoinj. But my question is, how does Bitcoinj work then? When using Bitcoin Core wallet, I noticed that my transactions do not go through to the network until my wallet is fully synced with the blockchain, so how can Bitcoinj bypass this requirement? I notice on their website it says: \"Highly optimised lightweight simplified payment verification (SPV) mode. In this mode, only a small part of the block chain is downloaded, making bitcoinj suitable for usage on constrained devices like smartphones or cheap virtual private servers.\" Where can I read more about how SPV works? Also, is anyone aware of a Golang library that has the same features Bitcoinj does? If not, Im probably going to have to try and create my own port, so Ill need to do SPV and Micropayment channels stuff, is this a mammoth undertaking? \n",
      "After watching the bitcoin community have a collective fit over the block size debate I have a few observations. The one Id like to offer today is that a consensus driven network should have a simple, clear, and well established method for responding to upcoming questions on consensus changes. With such a technical feature in place, hard data on consensus changes can be aggregated and made public. Without such a feature, a lot of energy is expending arguing about opinions. Having hard data can in turn increase the confidence for hard forking changes, which is a very valuable thing that could allow bitcoin to evolve smoothly, and even hard fork in dramatic changes that will help keep the ecosystem healthy and competitive. Ive seen many comments from devs that hard forking is really hard, takes a really long time, etc. Think about it. If you were going to design a globally distributed network that has no central control and could only be hard forked smoothly if everyone agreed, the first thing you might think about doing would be setting up a really clear method of communication amongst nodes about future consensus changes. In addition, you really want to be able to ignore actors who are not generally supportive of the smooth and functional operation of the bitcoin vision. As it stands, the default method of communication seems to be to wait for developers to compile new versions of software which then can be queried as to their version (i.e. Classic, Unlimited, Satoshi, XT) BIP9 (versionbits) works really well for establishing when the network is collectively ready to soft fork in features that are in the running code but not activated. But, having a productive discussion about future consensus changes (hard forks) via software upgrades leaves a lot to be desired. I assert that this is a suboptimal design, and that all bitcoin node software should implement a standard Ill call BIP9-hard that allows users to edit config files, or command line arguments, or knobs in the GUI in order to communicate responses to upcoming consensus issues. Responses to specific questions can be a lot more useful than opinions on reddit, slack, youtube, medium, etc. For example, an effective set of questions is: 1. Do you now have enough bandwidth, or are you willing/able to upgrade your bandwidth to support 8MB blocks? 2. If you are not willing/able, what is the blocking factor? Money or lack of availability? Another question: 1. How much lead time do you need to support X hard fork feature if consensus is reached? This technical functionality would enable a data based discussion around hard forks and consensus changes, that I feel is sorely lacking, and desperately needed. A closely related issue to this data based discussion capability is that community is currently in the dark regarding soft metrics around network health. 1. How many nodes have been abandoned? There are nodes running old, insecure versions of bitcoind. Are they still running because someone forgot to show down a VPS on their companys network, or are they supporting a wallet or an application that requires that version? This distinction is extremely important. In the former, that node can be hard forked off the network with no loss to anyone. In the latter, a benign community might work to find out how to get that node back on an intelligent upgrade path and avoid imposing a hard fork on that node. Id venture that no one in the bitcoin community who wants to see it succeed would argue that a forgotten and unused VPS running an old version of bitcoind should be a reason to not give bitcoin that awesome upgrade coming down the pipe that requires a hard fork. Right??? So no amount of awesome technical wizardry thrown at creating a consensus Q&A platform will help if the node operators are asleep at the wheel or are running nodes they forgot about. This leads me to believe that Bitcoin needs a node operators guide that deals with this weakness. e.g. in all the places where there are instructions on installing bitcoin nodes, make it explicit that if you set and forget a bitcoin node install, youre running 100% risk of that node ceasing to operate as intended due to a hard fork. In addition, if you go dark for X months in terms of responding to upcoming consensus polls, you loose the right to complain if you get forked off the network. Communicate people, communicate! The only way to know that node operators are paying a minimum level of attention is that they are running a recent version. Theres no way to prove that they arent paying attention if they are running an out dated version on their node(s). Let this be the basic principle: Its effectively impossible to operate a consensus network where the consensus rules are dynamic without establishing a highly effective communication method about change of consensus. This would not be a problem if Bitcoin consensus was set in stone from the early days. If it never changes, no one has to talk about change. They only run a node and transact on the platform or they dont. I think that if Bitcoin doesnt get behind the basic principle I laid out, it will likely not realize its full potential and will continue to generate a lot of traffic on reddit. :) \n",

      "I have wanted to own a bitcoin business for a while now. There have been services that come and gone in the past but most no one really offers a simple, easy, reliable way for anyone to buy bitcoin using a credit/debit card. I want to develop a site that would allow novices and experts to easily purchase bitcoin using prepaid card or credit card, without having to go through a ton of processes to get their coin & being bombarded with massive fees. In a relatively quick time. I am an experienced web developer with a fair amount of knowledge in bitcoin. My questions: 1). How should I set this up legally so that I am abiding by the laws & paying the right taxes? (I am looking for a bitcoin lawyer, if I can find one) 2). What type of verification could I go through that my visitors know that this is a legitimate service and not some scam site? 3). For security purposes I am thinking of handling all orders manually from my cold storage vault and delivering within 24 hours, thoughts? 4). I obviously dont know everything at the moment, so what major problems should I look out for when it comes to this? 5). What are your overall thoughts & concerns about this idea?

      "Hey guys, Im Steve, an early bitcoin advocate an bitcoin entrepeneur. I was the storeowner guy in the Rise and Rise of Bitcoin documentary (the guy that looks like Jeff Goldblum kinda). Anyway, there is this ponzi scheme company, Bitclub, that is opening meetups in various cities \"educating\" people on bitcoin. But what theyre REALLY doing is selling a cloud mining ponzi scheme. Heres the story: Someone opened up a bitcoin related meetup in my area - and I joined. Then, one of their people contacted me. I have a small physical storefront devoted to bitcoin, and he said he was real excited about this, wanted to meet me, blah blah. But then he started spewing stuff about cloud mining and telling me shit that I knew was factually incorrect. And thats when I knew something was up. Also, he was giving me the whole \"hard sell\" over the phone, he just wouldnt take no for an answer. I finally hung up on him because he was a complete idiot. So I decided to attend the meetup the following Monday. I was the only one there. Some other guy, obviously a sales rep, came and was telling me how great cloud mining was blah blah and trying to get me to join this \"bitclub\" thing. He too, didnt know what he was talking about. He didnt even know what the blockchain was! I later left because the meetup wasnt fun, the guy was an idiot, no one was there, and I didnt want to deal with his hard sell tactics. So I went home and researched these guys, and sure enough: (i particularly like the first post) I hate shit like this. One of the things I really liked about the bitcoin community is the whole hippie/hacker element to it and I hate it when shit like this fucks up the vibe. So I informed the guys at meetup.com about this, hopefully theyll shut them down. But there are others in other cities, so please be aware of this. If anyone out there experienced this, please inform the proper authorities (whether it be meetup.com, or potential \"recruits\", or the authorities or whatever). I plan on putting a warning on my company website about bitclub, because I feel the company is misleading people and a lot of people are going to be suckered out of a lot of money. I also feel that this will also give the bitcoin community a bad name. I dont want people equating \"bitcoin\" with \"scam\". But I also dont want bitclub giving me legal hassle saying its \"slander and libel\" or whatever (Im not well versed in law). Any lawyers out there know of any legal land mines to avoid before I post this up? Edit - 2/3/16 Guys, I wrote to meetup.com regarding this problem and they responded back: Hi there Steve, We very much appreciate your reports and have taken appropriate action from here. Could you send me a link to where this other Reddit member reported this incident? That will help further our investigation. Also, I very much encourage any reddit member you encounter who has a related or separate MLM report on Meetup to write in to us directly at abuse@meetup.com. If you ever encounter any other nefarious behavior or schemes on the platform, please reach out to us with any related links. Our policies ask that all Meetup groups be transparent and honest about their affiliations and cost so members know what to expect. Thank you again for all your help on this. \n",

      "The news about blockstream raising $55 million ( is terrible news for the bitcoin protocol since blockstreams entire business model is based on crippling the bitcoin code and sabotaging any attempt to scale the actual real bitcoin blocksize.

I dont see how people can remain bullish since this is no different to a new \"paypal coin\" coming along to \"rescue bitcoin\" from this internal sabotage and crippling limitations... If a new replacement crypto materializes and catches on bitcoin might not go to $0 but may likely go far below the cost of mining which would be just as bad and cause major problems since miners would simply switch off their machines. I wont envy those who buy bitcoin at a discount and realise that they will just have expensive pieces of corrupt code in this scenario. Yes halving is on the horizon but all it means is that miners will get less bitcoins for their electricity and therefore if the price doesnt double they may have to lose a significant percent of their profits or worse mine at a loss.

Worse, many people here think the rejection of SegWit by other implementations is a proof those other implementations are a coup. So please let me explain some problems the other side has with SegWit. - Many people (including me) think bitcoin needs to scale. We have this discussion for more than a year, and many people (including me) wants the discussion to end and pave the ways for Bitcoin to grow further. - SegWit may be great, technologically, but many people consider it not the best scaling solution. Why? - it gives a capacity of 1.7-2.0 MB if 100 percent of the network use it. More realistic are 1.3-1.5 MB during 2016. - while it gives this small increase in capacity, it opens immediately an attack vector like 4 MB blocks would do. With SW activated, you can spam the network with a capacity like 4 MB blocks. This attack vector will always be more then 2 times bigger than the real capacity and could be a major obstacle for future onchain scaling edit: As was pointed out, SegWit reduces the sigops and eliminates the risk of CPU-failure. - In the proposed implementation SegWit cuts the connections between space and fee. When implemented, the fees you will have to pay will no longer be factored by the space your transactions needs In the end: many people want a solution to the scalability problem and think the easiest and best solution is to just raise the blocksize. SegWit is no scaling solution, but a malleability solution with some scaling as a side effect. So, after one year of discussion we still got no real scaling solution, but a trade-off. A not-so-good scaling, but a fix to malleability. I hope you understad. Edit: Aaand the first downvotes arrive. Thank you! Edit Edit: Thanks for the discussion. Learning a lot about Seg Wit. Edit Edit Edit: Please dont say I should read the Faq on cores website. Ive done it one times, and it didnt adress this problems / questions, and it didnt do this when I read it the second time.

      "Hey folks. Ive created a couple new command-line tools and a simple website interface for them that requires no registration or signup. At this point, I think they are ready for some public testing and feedback. Maybe you will find them useful. ;-) The website is [mybitprices.info]( The site provides two related tools: 1) Price History Reporting: Enter your wallet addresses and view customizable transaction reports with historic price information, as well as present day price, and the difference (gain/loss). Euros and other major fiat currencies are supported, in addition to USD. Also available is a disposal (sales) report showing realized gains in schedule D format. Disclaimer: This is for informational purposes only and should NOT be submitted with your taxes. Consult with a qualified tax professional. Author not responsible for any calculation error, etc. This reporting uses data from the blockchain via [btcd]( as well historic price information from [bitcoinaverage.com]( 2) HD Wallet Address Discovery: Enter your HD wallets master XPub key and [the tool]( will automatically find all of your wallet addresses that have been used to date, including change addresses. These addresses can then be used in the Price History tool, or for your own purposes. Many (most?) HD Wallets do not provide a complete list of used addresses, but do provide the master XPub key. So this tool empowers users by providing information kept hidden by their own wallet software. This tool supports CoPay multi-sig wallets (which use multiple XPub keys) and in theory should work with other multi-sig wallets that implement Bip44. --- Command line tool: bitprices --- The price history reporting is powered by [bitprices]( a new open-source tool with a lot of flexibility. The tool can connect to multiple blockchain APIs including btcd, toshi and insight. btcd is fastest as the btcd developers were kind enough to accept a patch I wrote that speeds up the necessary query by orders of magnitude for some cases. --- Command line tool: hd-wallet-addrs --- The HD Wallet Discovery is powered by [hd-wallet-addrs]( This tool automatically derives wallet addresses and then queries a blockchain API to determine if the addresses have been used or not. The supported blockchain APIs are: toshi, insight, and blockchain.info. The Bip32 heavy lifting is done by the fantastic [BitWasp bitcoin-php]( library. These are open source projects and I welcome feedback, suggestions, bug reports, and contributions. \n",

      "So there are big holders on either side of the current hard fork effort. Given some of the people on either side, I dont think its a stretch to estimate that a handful of early adopters on each side easily control a six figure amount of BTC. We can get specific on estimating who has what, but lets skip that for now and just go with the question as a thought experiment. If both chains had people effectively voting in the way a free market does voting, with their wallet, how does either side walk away with out having their individual market caps destroyed? All of a sudden there will be a massive amount of supply being sold, and in an uncertain situation like a hard fork, if anything demand will probably be even lower than it would be during a regular period. But I cant help but notice in the discussions anytime someone mentions the fact that certain people are surely going to sell their BTC on the chain they consider inferior, the idea is just dismissed and downvoted. Additional related thought experiment: If you had information that a certain amount of BTC would be sold on your preferred chain, and you were 100% sure it would happen, how high would that number of BTC be before you would withdraw your support? edit: Just to make clear this isnt some Core has all the biggest whales and theyre going to dump it all on Classic! post.

Its possible that blockstream is just a brillant idea to finance bitcoin-development. Things like this are seen in Linux. But its better to ask. In Bitcoins structure the abuse of power has much bigger consequences for everyone involved than in linux. - Their first sidechain liquid was used between bitcoin exchanges. Does anybody know if it worked well? Did id provide any advantage about, lets say, ripple? Is blockstream building ripple 2.0 around bitcoin? - Can the government send men with guns to blockstreams new offices in the bay area and force them to manipulate the bitcoin protocoll? Would we see it - or would the great trust in core pretend that we notice? - Will Blockstream be able to route around every conflict of interest that may arise in the future? Many people trust their moralic integrity and who am I to doubt this. But is here any other balance than our trust? For example, when Blockstream sells sidechain with more anonymity and speed, wouldnt it go against their business-interest when they implement lightning, which promises anonyme and instant-transactions?

      "Rebit.com problem is their low bitcoin exchange rate. My experience with Rebit has been good. It does come at an additional hidden cost in the low exchange rate for bitcoin. I have repeatedly over the last year compared Rebits rate to reliable exchages such as bitstamp. Rebits rate was always significantly lower. Ok, fair enough. I just get tired of hidden things. It starts with however you bought the bitcoin which usually costs me 1% or more. Then way down at the end of the Rebit process you see the added charge for sending the cash to the province instead of the capitol city bank. The big one though is Rebit pretends it has no fees even its FAQs. I say, \"Just tell us the truth. You set fees into the exchange rate.\" Feb 5 2016 Here is the discussion (edited only for punctuation and caps) I had with their people on their website chat method: -Why are your exchange rates lower than on the regular exchanges like bitstamp. First chatter: Our rates are determined internally based on market factors -why are your exchange rates lower than any of the exchanges.. 160204 622 pm Rebit 365.79 USD = 1 BTC = 17,515.43 PHP Bitstamp 373.29 BTC-e 377.488 Bitfinex 373.17 Huobi 380.64 Bitstamp on blockchain.info markets 373.32 ...... 2nd Chatter: Yes our rates are different here because we put a spread on it As u know finex and stamp has huge liquidities vs the philippines -We have to pay coinbase a percentage. Then your company says it has no fees. Is this not a hidden fee giving the lower exchange rate than anyone else? We dont have a fee but we take it off the spread. Really depends on where you will be buying off your btc. And when. -\"we take it off the spread\" is a fee. Think its all aesthetics. You can call it a fee then. -So in your FAQ I will quote below you lie. FAQ Do you really have zero fees? Yes. Rebit does not charge users any fees to use the service. Sorry about that andi but u also have to understand that sometimes we have a high spread and sometimes we match it. Really depends on the liquidity of the market here. -How many days in a month do you match it? I have always seen it low. Cant say. It really depends. -I have promoted rebit.com but now feel sorry about it. Im sorry you feel that way but weve been getting a lot of volume from ofws and they still see it a cheaper alternative to traditional remittance services. Anyway. Do you have an account with us already? -Do you have anything else to say before I prepare my post for reddit? 9m ago. Seen. I dont give you any permission to post anything i said here on reddit but if you still do, just know that we arent hiding anything. Every market has its own ecosystem and thr PH Bitcoin market is where it is at, i.e. Pricing, because of uncontrollable variables. Im not forcing you to use Rebit, if you have other means of cashing out your bitcoins in the Philippines, no one is stopping you. I do not need your permission to report your statements. Do not worry I know this is your company position on fees. Perhaps you can get them to drop the false advertising in the FAQ that says you have no fees. Have a good day. My opinion is YOUR service is good. There is no need in my opinion to hide your fees nor misrepresent the costs in your service. Have a good evening andy. Were looking forward to your post. \n",
      "Im curious to know if there are any write-ups on the subject. I was recently watching the darknet documentary and made the connection that recently after the seizure of a massive amount of BTC there was massive overvaluation. This seems counter-intuitive in the sense that selling off a lot of something should drive the price down. Was the amount seized inconsequential in comparison to the bubbles inertia? By owning a high enough percentage are you able to artificially manipulate the market in order to cash out high? Did the closing of the market enhance perceived viability of the currency? Are the events completely orthogonal? Basically Im just curious to know if these events are related and how if possible.\n",

      "As we all know there is some dispute going on. I do have my side however i am trying to give my personal assumption of both internal agendas (Core and Classic). The two agendas:  Core:  Goal:  Keep bitcoin alive in the longterm, by any means.  Assumption:  Use LN to fix everything.  Agenda:  Fix transaction malleability because it is needed by LN.  Do this by using SegWit because it also gives you a bigger effective blocksize.  Introduce RBF because time is critical for LN in order to work.  Implement \"the rest\" (which is huge) of LN and deploy it.  Increase the blocksize afterwards by using a hardfork.  Classic  Goal:  Keep bitcoin alive (longterm and shortterm).  Assumption:  We can not rely on LN to fix everything, because they really suck at communication. Because of that we can not trust them at all.  They also have some really strange people speaking for them.  Agenda:  Increase the blocksize first and see how Segwit, LN, etc. are developing. TLDR:  Core: LN will fix everything. With segwit we are introducing some fixes which we need and we are buying time. When LN is deployed there wont be problems. And if a hardfork is needed then we will do it when the time comes after LN is available.  Classic: We can not rely on LN because it is still in a very early phase. We want bitcoin to work right now. If LN is working in 2 years than lets have another look. For the next 2 years 1MB is probably not enough. There are many other different reasons. But i think both agendas have a common goal. But the agendas are different. Just my 2 cents. Not saying my opinion because of reasons.\n",
      "There is a lot of discussion going on about soft forks and hard forks but many people dont seem to realize the difference or what is possible with a soft fork. A soft fork is a change in the consensus rules that makes some blocks that would have previously been considered valid, to be invalid, but does not allow previously invalid blocks to become valid. See also: On the surface this seems to allow for very little change but people have come up with clever tricks that allow all kinds of changes as soft forks. SegWit, for example lets you change the way transaction IDs are calculated, by no longer taking the signature into account when computing a transactions ID. Other changes that are possible with a soft fork are:  Increasing the block size limit  Raising the 21 million coins limit  Changing the target time between blocks or changing the PoW algorithm I tried to include reference links for the tricks used for these soft forks, but they triggered automatic deletion of the post so I had to leave them out.\n",

I’m writing now to tell you some stuff about it…. > >Horace and Pete is a new show that I am producing, directing, writing, distributing and financing on my own. I have an amazing cast: Steve Buscemi, Edie Falco, Alan Alda, Jessica Lange, Aidy Bryant, Steven Wright, Kurt Metzger and other guest stars. Also Paul Simon wrote and performed the theme song which is beautiful. > >The response to episode one has been great so far and there are more coming. We are making them now and having a lot of fun doing it. > >Part of the idea behind launching it on the site was to create a show in a new way and to provide it to you directly and immediately, without the usual promotion, banner ads, billboards and clips that tell you what the show feels and looks like before you get to see it for yourself. As a writer, there’s always a weird feeing that as you unfold the story and reveal the characters and the tone, you always know that the audience will never get the benefit of seeing it the way you wrote it because they always know so much before they watch it. And as a TV watcher I’m always delighted when I can see a thing without knowing anything about it because of the promotion. So making this show and just posting it out of the blue gave me the rare opportunity to give you that experience of discovery. > >Also because we are shooting this show in a multi-camera format with an emphasis on a live feeling, we are able to post it very soon after each episode is shot.

Well, the dirty unmovable fact is that this show is fucking expensive. > >The standup specials are much more containable. It’s one guy on a stage in a theater and in most cases, the cost of the tickets that the live audience paid, was enough to finance the filming. > >But Horace and Pete is a full on TV production with four broadcast cameras, two beautiful sets and a state of the art control room and a very talented and skilled crew and a hall-of-fame cast.

      "Diclaimer: This is not to sell LN as solution for scalability. Im just excited about the ideas and want to share and falsify / verify thoughts... . Is Lightning just a (clever) way to use Bitcoin transactions more efficiently? Can LN be seen as 0-conf (or -1 conf) txns but with trustless2 guarantees? Right now most funds are locked in singlesig wallets and we hold private keys (to have math guarantees) to be able to access our funds in the future. Now imagine funds being (time) locked in shared multisig wallets and we store mutually signed multisig transactions to be able to access our funds in the future. Thats the vision of Lightning Networks: We get instant payment verification, better fee utilization and better privacy by trading off timelock of funds. By exchanging1 mutually signed multisig transactions off-chain - in a trustless way - we \"change\" which funds everyone can (eventually) access. Enforcing these txns on the (relatively slow and expensive) blockchain is then only necessary to resolve disputes or to relocate funds to different multisig wallets. Since everyone can time-lock some funds and act as trustless intermediary this should - in theory - naturally lead to decentralisation. Small hubs benefit of higher channel throughput velocity which leads to higher fee pay-off utilization of the locked-up funds. I.e. Everyone will become a LN hub! :) The transition can be done gradually by slowly migrating to shared multisig wallets and postponing the publication of transactions. As long as we have signed txns that we could use anytime to \"get\" all our funds there is no need to do it immediatelly. There is also no need for trust since the funds can not be spend otherwise2 without our signature. While we dont need our funds they earn us some money by helping others1 to use txns more efficiently and save fees. Much of the involved complexity can be automated and transparent to the user interface. You simply make a payment - faster, cheaper and more private. . (1) I omitted how atomic trustless multi-hop txns work in detail. Also there are many ways to find \"cheapest\" paths for routing payments over multiple hubs. But even without any routing - i.e only single payment channels - it can already help shift significant load off the blockchain. The gains can then be increased gradually by developing more sophisticated routing schemes. (2) The trustless math guarantees are only almost as strong as direct on-chain txns due to the timelock trade-off. Signed off-chain txns are overridden with decreased locktime for them to becomes valid before previous ones in order to change access to shared multisig funds. This introduces a new risk of not publishing a transaction in time in case a counterparty defaults. Instead of making sure to (automatically) watch the blockchain this risk can be insured with a smart contract: sth like \"If you see a certain txn on-chain then make sure another txn gets published in time. If you fail then compensate me the lost funds.\" \n",

But this seems absolutely amazingly centralized to me. Same as samuraiwallet. Like, not saying our devs are doing anything evil, but this isnt even spread out, its mostly americans, its mostly blockstream developers, its mostly just websites hosted regular old ways on regular old web hosts that could be hacked as much as anything, all kinds of groups could seize this if they wanted. Like blockstream could declare that XT nodes were an attack on the network and never ever present those to anyone. Making it very hard for them to gain a place on the network. A hacker could connect a newly connected node to 8 of their own nodes, totally cutting them from the real block chain and forcing them to accept whatever fake blockchain they generated. LukeJr could make sure new nodes never connected to satoshi dice since hes been trying to filter satoshi dice for years. A few governments could team up and say \"hey you guys, we are going to subpoena your logs, we know wikileaks IP address, we want to see if he was connecting to the bitcoin network on march 15th\" or whatever.

      "Hello everyone, Im new to the field of cryptocurrencies, so I might have gotten something completely wrong. At first, Bitcoin and the concept of cryptocurrencies in general seemed very promising to me as an empowering tool. But when I looked a bit closer, it seemed as if for example Bitcoin has become a kind of hyper-capitalistic arena (is it called crypto-libertarianism??), where again people with the most resources (large Mining pools) have an unfair advantage over the others. So my two questions would be: 1. do you think this impression is correct? 2. can you point me to non-capitalistic, non-libertarian uses of the blockchain?\n",
      "During the scalingbitcoin.org event in Hong-Kong, miners underlined clearly that they wanted better communication with Core. Since the past monthes, criticism has grown and specifically targetted Bitcoin Cores poor communication. Since then, Bitcoin Core has taken alot of effort into improving its communication, creating a bitcoincore.org website translated in different languages, and a Slack team, in addition to its members remaining available on its historic communication channel, IRC. However, I expect Bitcoin Cores communication will stay kinda messy, and I think thats okay. Bitcoin Cores communication inherits from its decentralized, leaderless structure. So very much like decentralized system, its inefficient. Core is composed of many different open-source contributors each having their own opinions : there isnt even a specific definition for being a part of Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Core doesnt even exist legally. To be honest, I would become a little concerned if Bitcoin Cores communication becomes perfect and competes with Monsantos or Microsofts.\n",

      "We all know that in the early days there were many Bitcoins that were lost and will never be retrieved. Does anyone have any educated calculations on how many would be lost forever? Main reason I ask is that all market caps Ive seen of bitcoin always include every bitcoin that has ever been created (currently 15,178,575 BTC). This multiplied by the current price gives you a market cap around $5.7 Billion. When we talk about bitcoins market cap being pretty minuscule in the grander scheme, generally that market cap is referenced, but it could actually currently be much much smaller. If 3 million BTC were lost in the early days for example, the current market cap of Bitcoin would really only be around $4.5 Billion. A big difference from the current quoted market cap. Its just interesting to think about given the future growth of Bitcoin. Only 21 million ever being created is quoted a lot around here, but in reality there will never be that much in circulation due to lost coins that will never be retrieved. \n",

      "Where does the idea come from that the bitcoin system is untouchable unless every last node, miner and user agrees on a set of changes? This is not enforcable technically and therefore just wishful thinking, a plea. Not really bitcoins style. Bitcoin is and always will be controlled by the majority of hashpower. The hashpower itself will be influenced by the economic majority or may even be replaced if they misbehave, introducing a new hashpower (using a different algorithm). If a minority disagrees with a change they can voice their disagreement and try to persuade the others but then either accept the decision whatever it is, or exit the system effectively creating an altcoin. If their objections have had any merit this altcoin stands a chance to succeed. If not, it will fail pretty fast. Bitcoin creates consensus among its users. It is not a requirement for change.\n",
      "Reference: The idea is that once channels have been set up between entities in the network, value can be moved through these channels from one node to another. This allows two individuals to use the network to route payments. While I have no problem with that in the slightest, I have not seen a discussion about how businesses can participate given the regulations around Money Service Businesses and Money Transmission Businesses. After all, each node along the route must be willing to transfer value from one party to another. Hawala networks were banned in many places for this reason, though like Bitcoin they are distributed and autonomous, so effectiveness of such bans is pretty hard to determine. The Lightning Network though must recruit a wide range of participants to work as a decentralized autonomous agent for Bitcoin transactions. I am a big fan of lightning networks. But I cant be the only one that is a little worried about the potential for a regulation problem. Hopefully there is an easy answer.

Players can also see their current share and current payout value in the game.

The hackers did gain access to our SQL database, this means that sensitive user information may have been leaked, such as: e-mail addresses, phone numbers, names, etc. Will the funds be reimbursed to those that had an unauthorized withdrawal? Yes, we will return all the funds of the users who have had an unauthorized withdrawal. Whats next? Were going to take the following steps: Weve taken down the website for a security update. All of the passwords have been reset. Any withdrawals which were approved, but not processed yet, will all be rejected. Were going to implement additional security procedures, which will help with an earlier detection of such breaches. Once we bring the website up, we will request that our users change their passwords and update their TFA. When will the website be up? Our team is working overtime, so we hope that it shouldnt take us more than 24 hours. Well keep everybody posted via e-mail, Twitter and Facebook.\n",
      "I only used BitGo a couple of times a while ago. There was no need at that time for a second password when sending BTC, but they added this in the meanwhile so when I tried withdrawing my 0.1 BTC, the site requested a password that Ive never had and which does not match my current account password. Also at the time of deposit there was no warning \"Please check you still have the key of your account\" or something that should make me aware of the extra added security. After contacting support, they agreed that theres nothing I can do anymore and I should assume the money is gone. Fortunately I lost only 0.1 BTC but its enough to put me away from BitGo services. They probably are a secure service but not for everyday users. Be careful!\n",

      "We’re all witnessing an extreme amount of new hashing power increasing the difficulty to heights never seen before. This might seem like a good thing, more hashing power securing the Bitcoin network… But wait, have a look at the hashrate distribution: There are a total of 5 GIANT pools controlling ~82% of the TOTAL hashrate and increasing. I miss the times when people were running ASICs of their own and mining was truly decentralized. Right now, there is an unintentional incentive for miners to centralize. This has to change if Bitcoin is to become the solid foundation securing not only transactions on its own blockchain, but every layer that’s going to be relying on Bitcoin in the future (merged-mined sidechains, DNS-records, smart contracts and paymentchannels etc). The proposal to eliminate the unintentional incentive to centralize mining is to integrate a P2Pool fashioned mining protocol that would distribute the block reward to both big and small miners giving each their fair share. This solution would benefit EVERYONE in the Bitcoin community EXCEPT for the 5 biggest mining pools as they would have to share some of their reward with smaller miners. This has been thought of as a major roadblock to integrating this change because the biggest miners won’t mine on the new version because it’s giving them less reward. This topic has been suggested before but it never gained any traction due to the issue raised above. But in fact this is not really an issue. Imagine if the update was rolled with the consensus of the entire community except for the few biggest miners refusing to adopt it and still stubbornly mining on the old version. Their so beloved block reward would be worthless and they’d be forced to update. This is exactly the same reason why miners don’t create more than 25 new bitcoins per block even if they wanted to do so. Because they know that the rest of the Bitcoin community would consider their blocks worthless, that’s why they obey the rules of consensus. tl;dr  There is an unintentional incentive for centralized mining.  Fix it by hardforking a P2Pool fashioned mining protocol.  This would benefit the entire Bitcoin community except for the few biggest mining pools.  If the few biggest mining pools refuse to upgrade, their reward would be useless anyway.  Anyone who has an old dusty ASIC lying around, plug it in and mine away because it will be profitable again!\n",

      "While Theymos could use better PR, his description of a new fork of the Blockchain is accurate - its an alt coin. Let me explain what I mean. This is how a hard fork will play out: As soon as the grace period is over, the alt coin miners software allows them to produce 2Mb blocks which are INVALID for anyone using Bitcoin and will be thus ignored. Such a block will only be VALID to other nodes which have switched to the alt coin software as well - whatever its name. REALITY CHECK Consequences for Bitcoin: At least 75% of hashing power will vanish after the first invalid alt coin valid block is mined by the alt coin software running miners. Thats not a big problem for anyone because all it means is that transaction confirmation times will be slower for a while. But transactions are still all valid, and eventually theyll get confirmed and mined into a block on both the Bitcoin blockchain and the alt coin blockchain. HOWEVER! Once miners start to want to spend their mining reward - the freshly mined coins after the fork - thats when real problems will start. Miners: Are you really sure you want to go through with this? Because to be sure, you must know for certain that your favorite buyers are also switching to your alt coin software, otherwise your coins will NOT be valid to them, whom will you be able to sell those coins to then? What if an exchange that you like to use has not made the switch? What if merchants you like to pay dont want to switch? How are you going to protect your self against your coins not being worth anything? I dont think you can. Exchanges: Are you ready for pisst off users? What do I mean you ask? Well, if you switch to the alt coin software then after the hard fork some miners, which may be your clients, wont be able to use your platform to sell their coins. Worst case scenario has 25% of Bitcoin miners still mining coins that you will not accept! Are you ready for that hit to your bottom line? What about regular users? Theyll purchase coins on your exchange, some of which will be newly mined alt coins which theyll then withdraw to their own wallets. But did their favorite SPV wallet switch? Otherwise theyll never receive that transaction. And unless your customer has access to the private keys to be able to recover the coins at some other SPV wallet they wont be able to even get those coins back unless their favorite SPV wallet makes the switch. Are you really willing to risk for some of your clients to have these issues? OR when they try to spend their coins purchased on your exchange and they cant because theyre mixed with coins newly minted on the alt coin software and their favorite merchant didnt make the switch? Merchants: Well.. based on the consequences for the exchanges.. you get the picture what will happen right? Some customers just wont be able to spend with you and unless you run both chains you wont be able to even refund them and theyll lose coins because of you. ANY hardfork WILL have some volume of these problems. The important question to ask is: How much of these problems will the current consensus level produce? Obviously the less consensus there is, the more problems the hardfork will produce. Are we ready for this confidence hit? Bottom line is hard forks are a risky business. Because if users cant trust that their coins are valid everywhere where it says Bitcoin accepted, and that they wont run into some technical issue where their coins are lost unless the node they sent them to upgrades or their coins are worthless because their favorite node has upgraded, or because it didnt, youll see a lot of the following: - the price will drop - less people will want to hold them - miners will have less options to sell to - exchanges will have less volume - merchants will have less volume - the price will drop - less people will want to hold them - miners will have less options to sell to - exchanges will have less volume - .. - .. You get the idea. So, are you people(miners, exchanges, merchants) really sure you have the support to keep these consequences to a minimum? Gavin seems to think so. But do you really trust him? He didnt even have the foresight to give this issue priority over a payment network he spend a year implementing that no one is using today. Have you really made enough deal with the ecosystem to get enough people to switch to your alt coin? Conclusion: I fear that a hard fork without overwhelming consensus and a long grace period will be a disaster for everyone. Maybe thats exactly what is suppose to happen. I hope its not and I hope Im wrong. \n",

      "Right now all rewards (block reward and fees) go to the miners. As the price rises the block reward will beome worth more and more in fiat currency terms over time (given continued adoption). So miners will have that incentive until 2140. In the mean time why cant fees paid by users go directly to the full nodes propogating transactions. Miners get rewarded for security. (Block reward) Full nodes get rewarded for network propogation. (Transaction fees) Or why not some form of hybrid model where a percentage of the total block reward gets given the miner and a percentage distributed to full nodes based on their allocated bandwidth. Storj has this system in place already rewarding users (nodes) for their storage and bandwidth. We expect miners to secure the network so we reward them, if we expect full nodes to decentralise and propogate the network the only logical incentive can be a reward also albiet a lesser reward as it is far cheaper to run a full node than to mine with asics.

[If we look a few days ago]( we see that AntMiner mined 5 single transaction blocks. Eligius had 2. Slush and KNCminer also had 1. So whats the deal? Were there just not enough transactions at the time the block was mined for the block to include any transactions? Or are those pools just been picky about which transactions they include?

      "I wanted to simulate what would happen in the event of a fork to see how likely it was for minority hashpower to overtake the majority chain by getting lucky. I tested this with various minority hashpower settings (from 5% to 50%) to see how likely it was to overtake the forked chain. Assumption  \"Minority\" hashpower will always mine the old chain.  \"Majority\" hashpower will mine the longest chain they see first.  If the majority chain gets 100 blocks ahead, it is unlikely to get orphaned and the simulation stops. Note: This assumption is generous to the majority chain, as a minority chain with a significant amount of hashpower has reasonable chances of overtaking even 100 blocks. However, for a 75/25 split, its quite low.  If the majority chain is orphaned, I count it as an orphan, and stop the simulation.  I test 100,000 times at each level. Results Minority Share  Minimum Orphan Rate ------ 5%  0.27% 10%  1.24% 15%  3.14% 20%  6.29% 25%  11.12% 30%  18.29% 35%  29.00% 40%  44.37% 45%  66.93% 50%  98.04% Conclusions  75%/25% split is incredibly dangerous to miners on the majority chain. They get orphaned > 10% of the time.  If the actual hashpower at activation is <75%, it is even more dangerous. This happens in one of several likely ways - forking miners could get lucky when triggering the activation, miners could get cold feet and change their mind, miners could come online that do not support the fork changing the ratio, or miners could vote for the fork and refuse to mine it to trick others into mining a fork that will be orphaned.  If the actual hashpower split is 65%/35%, the fork will get orphaned 29%.  If the actual hashpower split is around 58%/42%, the fork will get orphaned over half of the time!  A hardfork bit that prevents the old chain from overtaking the new chain will provide a much safer hard fork, as a minority chain getting lucky does not harm the new chain.  Fork at your own risk if you are mining. 75% support is FAR from sufficient to reduce risk.

As of now they are having 2300 individual deposits that they pay every hour, resulting in 2300 deposits an hour. This is ~0.7 / second. This on a network where 3 / second is much. Another thing is that they are depositing a heavy amount of small sums to peoples wallets, resulting in a huge amounts of data when they are sent again. A deposit made 4 days ago is now 96 much smaller payments. The fee will be higher on these transactions, sure, but the stress on the network is still big. Any other reflections on this?

      "The topic of how SPV mining is bad has come up several times in the last year. There was a [recent proposal]( to demand that miners prove that they have received all of the contents of a block before they can start mining. There have been various proposals in the same spirit over the years. I think making miners prove they have the full contents of the block they are trying to build on is a bad idea, because it puts miners at a disadvantage if they cannot rapidly acquire the entire block contents. This task favors centralized players with high bandwidth, low latency connectivity, which is expensive, and the problem gets worse the larger blocks get. Players with poor connectivity will fail to mine profitably because too much of their time will be spent receiving and validating each block. A similar benefit could be achieved without the negative centralization impact if the miners are asked to provide evidence that they validated a block far enough in the past. For example, if miners were required to provide evidence that they validated a block at height H - 4 when mining the block at height H, then you have a situation where there is a 99.9% chance that the block at H - 4 will have been broadcast more than 250 seconds ago. On average, miners would have 30 minutes to receive and validate the H - 4 block. I do not know exactly what kind of evidence the miners should be asked to provide. It would be nice if the evidence had the following properties: 1. Showed that they actually validated the block, not just that they knew it. Alternatively, it could maybe just take a similar amount of time as validation takes, so that there is no temporal cost to validating in parallel. 2. Verifying the evidence would not add much time to the overall block validation step. 3. Verifying the evidence would not be necessary to perform the rest of the block validation. Like with segwit, nodes could skip this verification if they wanted to. 4. Was hard to outsource. For example, perhaps the proof could incorporate the header from block H-1, or some of the intermediate mining steps that would only be accessible to someone who was about to solve the block. The above idea could be implemented with a soft fork, and would create incentives that would practically guarantee that miners would would validate every block as soon as possible. It would not absolutely enforce that behavior, so theoretically miners could construct a chain 3 blocks long on top of an invalid block before they were forced to prove knowledge of the bad block. I think this would be incredibly unlikely if the above idea were implemented because the cost to behave \"properly\" would be negligible, and if you misbehave you risk losing a lot of money. But what if such a chain were produced? First of all, unless the network is deploying a soft fork, fully validating nodes would not accept the bad block and would not notice the bad chain. As I understand it, the fact that SPV nodes do not validate blocks could cause them to follow this bad chain, however this vulnerability could be improved with a simple fix. When validating nodes serve blocks to SPV nodes, they would include a message to indicate that they have personally validated the block. SPV nodes could be configured to consider a block \"provisional\" until several nodes indicate that they have validated the block.  My first reaction to this issue was that SPV mining did not present a big problem because miners are incentivized to validate as soon as possible, and discard blocks or chains when they discovered they were invalid. I have changed my mind this weekend and suggest making the changes described above. What I realized, is that while SPV mining is pretty harmless during normal operation, it can be disastrous during a soft fork. Consider this scenario: 1. A soft fork is being rolled out, and whatever threshold of miners has been reached. Blocks that do not conform to the soft fork are officially considered invalid. 2. An un-upgraded miner produces a block that is valid according to the old rules, but invalid according to the new rules. 3. Even though they indicated that they were ready for the soft fork, a large fraction of the miners are just SPV mining, not actually validating. They do not notice that this block does not obey the rules of the soft fork and they build on it. Call this chain B for bad. 4. Un-upgraded nodes cannot notice that these blocks are \"bad.\" They see these blocks as confirming transactions. 5. Miners who have upgraded, and are validating, reject the longest chain and continue working on the soft fork. Call this chain G for good. 6. Upgraded nodes follow chain G. 7. The network therefore experiences an unplanned hard fork between chain B and chain G. Eventually all miners will switch to one of the two chains, but it cannot be known ahead of time which chain will win. This is pretty much a worst case scenario. From the above, part of the personality of a soft-fork becomes more clear to me. During a soft fork, it is impossible for fully validating nodes, if they are not upgraded, to determine whether or not they are on the correct chain. This puts almost all of the power and responsibility on the miners. If they mine without validating during this delicate phase, no one else is positioned well to correct their mistakes. Un-upgraded nodes are effectively turned into SPV clients -- not just for transactions making use of newly rolled out features, but for the question of which chain is valid. Ideally, miners would: 1. Receive the solved header for H - 1 2. Start mining H with no transactions 3. Receive a compact message that allows them to include at least some transactions while mining H. 4. Receive the main block H - 1 absent the SW and do a complete (provisional) update of the UTXO state. Prioritize transactions and start mining a full block. 5. Receive the segregated witness for H -1 and fully validate the block. 6. Discard the current block and roll back the utxo state if you have discovered that H - 1 is invalid. Forcing miners to validate prior to hashing could cause most miners to stop validating at all and outsource the validation job to specialists with low latency internet connections, much like how high frequency trading is done on computers that are physically located close together. This is not a good idea. Why is introducing anything that allows miners to \"make progress\" toward solving a block a deadly sin, but this proposal, which allows certain miners (especially the one who solved the last block and already has it and knows that it is valid) to get a head start is a-ok?\n",

      "I ran into an odd scenario on Blockchain.info (I know I know I know.. but just bare with me because this is probably not their fault). I have a wallet there with several addresses. I generate a new one for each incoming transaction. There is about $2,000 worth of BTC in this wallet combined. Yesterday (~36 hours or so ago) \"Alice\" had to send me $50. So she sent me $5 to one address, and $45 to another. Both transactions never confirmed, and still havent confirmed. Anyways, I was doing some internal wallet cleanup, and wanted to consolidate all my BTC thats scattered across multiple addresses into 1 newly created address. I send $2050 (my old balance + what Alice sent) to this new address, and lo&behold, now this transaction hasnt confirmed for nearly 24 hours. When I click on this tx, it says:  Network Propagation 0% - 1 Nodes - (Very Poor). Even though the Estimated Confirmation Time says \"Very Soon\", the warning next to it says \"This tx spends an input which is unconfirmed\". Essentially - now because of Alices original 2 txs totaling $50 have not confirmed for 1.5 days, all of my funds are now tied up in this limbo 0-confirmation transaction! This certainly sucks! 1) Theres no way my consolidation tx will confirm (and ignore Alices measly $50 payment), right? 2) What is eventually going to happen, and in approximately how long? 3) Is there anything I can do to at-least free up my original $2,000 from this mess? Can I export the entire wallet keys in .json, and import it into another new wallet somewhere and broadcast from those original addresses? Can I export the .json into another wallet somewhere and simply cancel this entire debacle all-together? Any insight provided would be helpful. I know the standard \"Dont use BC.I\" and I also know the \"Eventually transactions get confirmed, or they wont and stop broadcasting\". But this is a unique situation. FYI - Alices two txs both had a 0.0001 fee, and both have 0% (Very Poor) network propagation. My consolidation tx had a hefty 0.001 fee, and 0% - 1 Nodes - (Very Poor) Propgation.

      "Somebody asked me why the super rich dont generally buy Bitcoin in bulk. TLDR: There are many layers of complexity that massive portfolios have that make it harder to buy Bitcoin. Lots of reasons but here are some logistics: First we have to assume they like the story, believe in Bitcoin and have a buy in. Basically the super rich do things in a different and more complex way than normal people -- they will have an investment department in thier family office and a Chief Investment Officer, a head for Private Equity, venture, real estate, hedge funds and so on -- when you have $20 billion for example....even if you put half a billion freakin dollars into each investment....thats still a whopping 40 investments you have -- (and no one does that anyway) That means if there is a monthly board meeting by phone, say twice yearly in person reviews or meetings and say, 10 pages of analysis a month to read on each investment then thats 80 flights and 400 phone calls and 4800 pages of information to read a year.....and that doesnt even include emergencies, a CEO dying, a lawsuit, managing the investment staff, listening to 10,000 pitches etc etc ----- so basically you need a mess of staff. The investment managers are called all day, every day...not just by Joe Sixpack the local financial advisor, but by Lloyd Blankfein and Henry flippin Kravis. Then JP Morgan comes along with a preferred client fund that only the top management and a tiny number of select clients can invest in....now you have 41 investments. And this is at $500 million a pop. People dont do that on $20 billion -- even on $700 billion sovereign wealth funds they are often in the $100 million range. Thats huge, even for giant investors. Now Joe the genius hedge fund star leaves Apollo and starts his own fund -- his track record is awesome and you like him and know that if you support him on his first raise youll always be welcome....so what do you do? Give him $500 million? Hells no. No one would do that -- as Chief Investment Officer you will give $1 mil or 5 or maybe 25 mil to a new fund if they really love the guy...but if its 25 mil then you will want part ownership in the actual fund and a board seat.....now you have two more investments, the fund and the fund company. To top this off -- how do you track all this? You have the investments split between the family charity, and some in offshore vehicles for that since its tax free but then mirror funds in the US with taxes some funds are not even originally domicile in the US, many have no daily valuation ....sometimes the investments with XYZ PE Fund are actually over 3-4 funds from that company. So now you have 200 investment statements coming in every month. How do you organize it? Expensive software that doesnt integrate, data entry etc...another half time employee. They are at different banks, custodians, some are illiquid etc. When the time for performance reporting comes how do you track it all etc. and especially considering taxes. When you need money for the new London townhouse you sell something that has gone down to balance some earlier gains but its in two different entity ties and three different jurisdictions. You have layers of trusts and corporations and holding companies holding various investments. Now if you are a family office manager you also are handling everything from jet charters to security personnel to buying junior a new house to suing the reporter who lied about rhe boss to finding the rare part for a 1962 Porsche and auditing the house manager of the home in the Alps because you suspect hes been cooking the books on household expenses. At 10pm on Thursday the boss calls and needs $400k for a rare Beretta shotgun he found on vacation in Itally - heres the auction house number, get someone to call, speak Italian, get it done, get it insured and make sure its legal to ship from Italy and to the US. The investment team meets weekly, meetings with the boss are monthly but also many special trips -- visits to the bank, due diligence on companies etc. Add Bitcoin to this mix-- its weird, odd, you dont have any custodian that your team recognizes who will accept it. They dont know what department it should be under, whos responsibility to manage etc. They decide to take a position, do some due diligence on XYZ Bitcoin and go with them -- the bean counters go visit XYZ and you hire an auditor and a security consultant to make sure its as secure as they say ....this all takes a couple months. Then the Chief Investment Officer calls his pals at XYZs lead investors and gets an intro to the CEO and after some paperwork and verification gets XYZ to agree to a million a day instead of $50k maximum....but to do this XYZ needs blah blah legal form and an audit or whatever....this is a pain for XYZ btw because they dont know for sure the client will actually buy and they dont make a huge amount relative to the work but they are great and make it all work out. Your internal legal council needs to change the holding co because hes concerned about obscure liability issue and your tax accountant has a list of other concerns. Your estate attorneys have you in for 7 meetings to discuss if Bitcoin can be added to the Grat or your old obsolete family limited partnership and they determine the cold storage needs multi-sig this needs legal agreements etc. Finally its all done. Yay. Now we can buy Bitcoin. We buy a million dollars worth. The bank calls and freaks out because they saw $1 mil and \"Bitcoin\" - they temporary lock the account. You yell at them, threaten to pull business and finally Mr. Big calls a board member and the CEO fixes it with apologies ....that takes 7 days. Now you start again, you buy a million a day every weekday for three months, we need a trader to do all those buys and it takes hours a day to try to get the blocks without moving the market. You get another $30 mil from big block purchases from Binary, miners etc. You do all this while trying to not be noticed, not have anyone mention your name etc because the boss wants to be low profile. You bring in accountants and experts and learn about cold storage remembering that everything is bigger, different and harder for zillionaires. Also when you hire PWC to check this out and recommend security systems etc. - they are not going to risk their relationship with a big client by messing around...they will charge $100k and have a comprehensive analysis done. So now you have $100 million in Bitcoin. Moon! BTC goes to $1200 per coin in a year! Yay! Much win. Guess what? On your $20 billion portfolio that gained 12% that year.....even after all this time and this incredible luck of Bitcoin tripling in value.... it has accounted for only 1/12th of your gains for the year....basically a months interest on the overall portfolio. No manager thinks it will triple. If they estimated a crazy pie in the sky of 50% return then you are looking at a weeks worth of interest to buy something thats experimental and very risky. So -- overall -- Bitcoin has gone from inaccessible, to Dwalla to Gox to now great models like Coinbase & Circle. If you are a rich dentist, no problem. If you are a very rich business owner and want to buy $10 mil worth...a little effort and you can do so. But for the truest global rich we have a bit more of a ways to go before we will see it broadly in major portfolios. \n",

Perhaps I may have set the title of this post to be misleading. As it is in no way a challenge, setting up a full node is super easy. There is one rule though, do not host new full nodes in the cloud such as that ran by Amazon or Microsoft. It is preferable to setup the full node on your own network. Reason why is because if majority of nodes were hosted under one of the major \"cloud providers\" it would allow that company to do a sybil attack on the network. Current status: Also, if have any old miners be sure to turn them on again even if it is just paying itself in electricity and not making profit.

I own 4x more gold by value (at this moment) than I own Bitcoin, but Ive always wondered how you put the world back together with gold when trust in the financial system and in the government has been blown to hell. Sure people trust gold, but in order to do much with it you need trusted intermediaries. If we have to rely on gold, but we dont trust the system, then most of the complexity in the world will disappear, along with most of the people. Bitcoin is a product of the last financial crisis. Satoshi realized that without something like Bitcoin, the inevitable worldwide financial crisis would create a new dark age. Gold will thrive along with Bitcoin because people understand gold, and Bitcoin will allow the trusted value in gold to be put to work. As this plays out, gold will become less important and the value entrusted to gold will be transferred to Bitcoin. In the past, the value entrusted to gold was transferred to government bonds, fiat currencies and financial instruments, produced and controlled by inherently un-trustworthy intermediaries.

I can upload later on this week so everyone else can continue to use Bitcoin Armory. I have the installers of the various versions for each operating system. Though I also want the verified source code so the project can be continued. IF someone can do me a favor and point me to the VERIFIED source code and the two installers I am missing please let me know so I can include in the upload with my archive.

      "user /u/allenpiscitello claimed that activating a hard fork at 75% miner support had \"11% rate\" orphan risk, based on his simulations. I believe that his simulations are incorrect or incorrectly interpreted. The orphaning risk is actually quite small. My siulation code is here. I hope it is correct, but I dont have much experience with Python. Here is what that program tells me (based on 160000 simulated forks): If, when the big blocks are enabled, the big-block camp still has only 75% of the hashrate, they can expect to lose 0.54 blocks due to orphaning by the small-block miners, before the fork stabilizes (that is, their own branch gets an irreversible advantage). That is not \"10% of the blocks\", but a bit more than half a block total. That is, there is least 40% of chance that the big-block side will not lose any blocks. On the other hand, if the program is correct, there is almost 1 chance in 100 that there will be a reorg that junks 6 big blocks or more, and 1 chance in 1000 that there will be a reorg that junks 12 big blocks or more. So, to be really safe, one should (a) wait much longer -- 100 blocks or more -- right after the fork, before trusting any transaction issued after the fork; or (b) use a \"clean fork\" instead of a simple hard fork, as you suggest, so that either group rejects the blocks of the other group; or (c) let the majority miners sabotage the minority branch after the fork, to convince them to switch. Here is the full table: hP Reorgs Orphans Reorgs6+ Reorgs12+ ---- -------- -------- ---------- ---------- 0.95 0.03 0.03 0.0000 0.0000 0.90 0.07 0.08 0.0001 0.0000 0.85 0.12 0.16 0.0003 0.0000 0.80 0.20 0.30 0.0022 0.0001 0.75 0.31 0.54 0.0091 0.0007 0.70 0.49 1.01 0.0289 0.0046 0.65 0.79 2.06 0.0810 0.0216 0.60 1.39 5.24 0.2281 0.0927 0.55 3.26 23.25 0.7783 0.4283 hP = fraction of hashpower on big-block side Reorgs = expected number of reorg events before stabilization. Orphans = expected number of big blocks orphaned in those events. Reorgs6+ = expected number of reorgs that lose 6 or more blocks. Reorgs12+ = expected number of reorgs that lose 12 or more blocks. It must be observed also that the situation is similar to an attack where a miner (or miner coalition) with 25% of the hashpower tries to force a reorg of the main blockchain, by selfish mining a parellel branch. So, if the orphan rate was indeed 11%, as claimed in that other post, this attack would also achieve that success rate -- which is absurd, right?\n",

      "Hey everyone, Ive been what you call an early adopter. I have done well as an investor and as a recreational user of banned substances. These two things corralate with one another because this medium of exchange has been consistant in providing me with comics from californian comedian who I wont plug. I also got high quality stuff youd never expect within days delivered to my door. That was my early experience in 2012. It was a little investment of $60 and when I looked again it was worth $300. I used it to buy things. Now in 2015 I revisited this investment because I found that its accesibility and use became easier. I found it strange that it was so undervalued considering the growth it had in a span of a few years. Also the shift had dramatically moved to Asian and Scandinavian countries. I think this was in line with the perspective about access and exchange. It made sense to me at least. So recently Ive been wondering is this stability more about where bitcoin will go when it decides to do necessary upgrades? Has the value settled here because it can be used right now but it isnt necessary to upgrade? I think we should upgrade and I believe it would be amazing if they did proceed with a hard fork solution. Mainly because I think it will add value to the currency. It would also set unprecedented opportunities. Why is hard forking so dangerous? I dont believe bitcoins would be lost if its done. I think the system will adjust itself. I heard of this thing that happened with computers called Y2K where people foolishly believed the year would roll over and important banking system would break because it would be operating on year 00 in 2002. But nothing happened. So maybe it would be the same with the hard fork? These are just questions; thanks for reading. You guys are so cool I think youre changing the world.

      "There is a background story that makes this deal a little more interesting than it first appears to be. A few weeks ago taxi drivers started to protest against Uber, because theyve reached a deal some years ago that every taxi has to use the same price. And this price is very high. Also they have introduced a bunch of more regulations, like every taxi had to be painted to yellow and so on. Very quickly only a few big taxi companies remained on the market so they have reached their goal. However with Uber everything has changed. They dont have to follow the taxi regulations, so they could lower the price of the ride like 5 times. What has created the oligopoly of the big companies it backfired them badly. So taxi drivers started to protest. However there is one last important thing to know about hungarian taxi drivers. It is very hard to make a distinction between them and the maffia. With their protest it has became very clear for Hungarian people how rotten their culture is. In sum they just made a huge advertisement for uber. (Proof in appstore statistics) This brings us to Budapest taxi bitcoin deal. Altough it is always good when someone starts to accept Bitcoin, this move kindof brings a hatred on Bitcoin from the mainstreem since we are at the tipping point of hating taxis right now. So the hungarian people like me who pays with Bitcoin whenever we have the chance find ourselves in a huge dilemma: which principle we should apply this time. Using uber and with this fighting against our taxi maffia or using bitcoin and with this fighting against the banking maffia. \n",

      "Contentious - causing or likely to cause an argument; controversial. As I understand it a contentious fork proposal in Bitcoin-land has always meant a proposal to fork with less then a 90% - 95% threshold. A super majority does not have to be 95%, in fact, the most used super majority thresholds are 3/5 and 2/3. Yet, I will say that for a project like Bitcoin a super majority threshold of 90%, 95% or even 99% should be implemented. All proposals that do not adhere to these thresholds should be rejected automatically. This includes HF, SF and any changes what so ever. Here is why: Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer, trustless, decentralized, censorship resistant and pseudonymous (soon to be anonymous hopefully) currency and settlement network. These features constitute the real \"killer app\" for Bitcoin and are a great base to build layers on top of. 1. Resistant to change Even though the Bitcoin network is trustless, the development and politics in Bitcoin is not. For a money and settlement network to have any value, users need to be sure that the important rules do not change. This is why gold is trusted. Gold is a chemical element that no human can create. If a \"small\" majority of scared, panicked bitcoin users can force a blockchain increase, then in some distant future, so too can they change the total amount of bitcoins in existence. The \"hard\" rules of Bitcoin today is only safeguarded by incentive and logic. We then are at the mercy of the majority of people acting rationally. This is bad. A 90%+ consensus rule will make the Bitcoin code very hard to improve and change. Some will think this is a bad thing, however it is vital to Bitcoin. Here is why. Smart network A network where changes and innovation takes place on/in the network itself. (In a centralized way) A much used example of this is the old telephone networks. Smart networks with stupid clients in the end. If you wanted new features, it would have to come from an upgrade in the network by the phone company (often monopolies) In its over 100 year history, the most exited innovation was number identification. Dumb network A network that offers only basic features but does so very well and requires intelligent end-user devices. The network is dumb but innovation takes place at the edges with smart clients. The internet is such a dumb network. It only sends packages, it does not make decisions about content. Just 1`s and 0`s. A dumb network becomes a platform for decentralized innovation, without permission, at the edge. This means, that beyond a certain point (Bitcoin 1.0) we never need to change or update the protocol ever. (Unless some major bug or problem is discovered and we get 90% - 99% consensus.) Everything we need, fast transactions, cheap transactions, smart contracts, anonymity, etc, can all be built in layers on top of Bitcoin.Things we can not imagine today, will be built on top of Bitcoin. This however is impossible if Bitcoin is not kept: peer-to-peer, trustless, decentralized, censorship resistant and anonymous. The big blockers will get a gazillion transactions per second, the small blockers will get their digital gold. We will have contracts and DAO`s coming out of our wazoo. If we can only keep it resistant to change. Edit: format\n",

Ethereum caught my interest a few weeks ago and it seemed like a nice \"next step\" for the Bitcoin technology to me, until I found out about the Microsoft and R3 link. Isnt it true that Ethereum can do the same stuff as bitcoin plus more? If so, isnt it likely that the big banks will simply promote their own Ethereum based technologies as something like \"safe bitcoin based currency\" and then keep most of the people subscribed to them? Ethereum community, at first glance, seems similar to Bitcoin community to me, in that it looks like it is made of enthusiasts and programmers who like decentralization. Why are the people on Ethereum subreddit happy about the whole R3 thing? Is it just because of the media attention and exposure? Do you think the Ethereum community is \"legit\"?

We could create a new transaction type which old clients would see as \"anyone can spend\" but miners and new clients would see them as \"special uncollected outputs\" (SUO), also this transaction would create new output in STC with basically same rules as original Bitcoin rules except that they would allow larger blocks (there could be some smarter algorithm determining block size based on miner voting etc.) and merkle tree of those transactions would be included in coinbase of main Bitcoin chain.\n",
      "Bear with me because there is a point related to bitcoin in what Im about to write: A couple of weeks ago I published a project for an art nude photography book on kickstarter. Some people contributed but I wasnt able to reach the goal. To be fair, the goal was pretty high and the deadline to reach it was too short. So at the end of the deadline the goal was not reached. It was my first time using kickstarter, so I had no idea what I was doing. I was just sort of experimenting with it to see what would happen. From that experience there were two things that really caugth my eye. One: Kickstarter keeps a 5% processing fee and Amazon takes another 5% if the project gets funded sucessfuly. At first I thought that was fine. After all, kickstarter was finding me investors for my project. But then something happened that seemed unfair to me and its the second thing that bothered me about the experience: Kickstarter actually told me to promote my project among my friends on social media so I could get more funding. What? So let me get this straight: Kickstarter wants to charge me 5% -and Amazon another 5%- for the money I can get just by asking my friends and followers on social media? What do I need kickstarter for then? Again to be fair, kickstarter did provide a few contributors without me having to ask my friends. Had the project been successfuly funded, it wouldve been 100% fair that kickstarter recieved a 5% \"finders fee.\" So I thought: why doesnt Coinbase or Circle compete against kickstarter using bitcoin? Coinbase could set up a system for people to fund projects with bitcoin and only charge the 1% comission for converting bitcoin to dollars or to any other local currency. The 1% fee alone would be enough to attrack people. In the meantime, if you want to contribute to my project you can check it out here: Honestly, Id much rather get it funded through Coinbase (no fees), so if you feel like contributing with bitcoin the best way to do it is to open a Coinbase account and send the coins from the account to blogdeizquierda@gmail.com so I can be aware of who sent the coins and I can contact them to send them a reward for their contributions. The rewards would be the same as the ones in the kickstarter project. Now, in order to make this fair, I propose the following: If I do not reach the funding goal at kickstarter, then I will give back all of the bitcoin donations from coinbase. If I do reach the goal, then I will send the rewards in the same amount of time as stated in the kickstarter description. Also, to make it fair, if I receive a contribution of less than 25 dollars, which is the minimum contribution on kickstarter, I will return the contribution to the sender unless the sender specifically states he does not want any reward in exchange and whishes to contribute a smaller amount anyway. Finally, and only because this is a nude photography book (nothing explicit, although there is full frontal nudity), I need to find a way to verify the age of the contributor. In theory, all Coinbase users who want to buy or sell bitcoin are supposed to be at least 18 years old unless their parents provided written consent to Coinbase for their kids over 13 years of age to use the service. But wallet users who just want to send and receive bitcoin dont need to verify ID. That creates a problem, as the only way for me to verify age is through an ID. So the only way I can deliver the rewards to contributors is by requesting a photo of the contributor with an ID without sensitive information (deleting home address and ID number), just showing name and date of birth. I know this is cumbersome but I really cant think of any other way to figure out somebodys age without looking at an ID or without receiving payment through a credit card. Im open to suggestions, though. The only way I wouldnt need to look at an ID is if the contributor stated he does not want a reward at all, but I dont think that would be fair. (See? This is why Coinbase should be doing a kickstarter system and take care of the age verification.) Crap, this is just too complicated.... Anway, I hope this makes sense. My point is, if Im going to be the one finding people to fund my project, I shouldnt give kickstarter 5% and another 5% to amazon. And the only way I can see that working is through bitcoin. PS: For those who want to contribute through a desktop or mobile wallet I can send you an address to send the contribution to if you send an email to blogdeizquierda@gmail.com so I can know who to contact if I have to send a reward. PS2: Yes, I know this is probably the corniest post Ive ever published, but hey; they call us crazy for believing in bitcoin.\n",

How can it be stable if tomorrow a better technology can come up and make Bitcoin completely obsolete? And this can happen over and over again? 2.

How can Bitcoin stop the government gangs from stealing your money if it is not anonymous, i.e. you have to use real, bank-linked identity to buy Bitcoin? Isnt that even worse than the cashless society, which government bandits all over the world are now aggressively proposing so there is no escape from their banditry? 4.

      "Id like to run bitcore and having a royal pain in the ass getting it to work on old hardware. Dev machine Running the blockchain on it is too slow, therefore need this on a seperate dedicated box. Old Mac Firstly I tried a mac from 2007... after wiping it an putting Ubuntu 14 on, ran it up only to get \"Invalid chipset\" because of the shitty chips in the mac. Old Laptop (2009) Running Windows with 60Gb HD that I used to use on an old mining rig Tried using bitcored on that, installed node/npm bitcored... wont run on Windows. Blanked HD and installed Ubuntu. Now keep getting BSOD intermittently (grr) but did get it working. Horay! But then the HD was full at around 70% of the blockchain downloaded after 4 days. New External HD purchased. Bought a 1TB HD, formatted it with Ubuntu and encrypted. Copied 70% of blockchain from local drive to external one and resumed after finding the -d data directory option. Now getting 0.1 blocks per second... a good 30x slower than before. Turns out encryption is DREADFUL to have enabled on a blockchain HD. Killed that process, to run it again... blockchain corrupt now. WTF! I cant seem to install or run anything now so going to throw the whole lot in the bin. Before I start again, anyone care to share their low end specs that will work with bitcore? All I want to do is upgrade to bitcore to create a HD wallet system with it and seems like pulling teeth just to get the BWS bit running and Ive not even started on the wallet side.

      "We are usually told that Gold is better than BTC since the metal has some \"alternative real use\", while BTC is just the result of a \"subjective perception\".. I disagree: not only BTC has an intrinsic value, but it is even measurable.. If you have one Satoshi, this empowers you to write whatever message you want inside the first incorruptible digital medium in History... Such message will endure forever.. unchanged, undeleteable (and even time stamped!). It does NOT MATTER HOW MANY DOLLARS YOU HAVE (or how much Gold): if you dont have bitcoin, then you simply CANNOT ACHIEVE SUCH EXTRAORDINARY GOAL. Therefore, bitcoin HAS an intrinsic and unique value (no other crypto offers the same level of security, not even close). Of course, you have to pay some fees at this moment in History (and more in the future) and thats where you can actually (try to) measure this intrinsic value.. The more BTC you have, the more information you can write.. Right now we are using such incredible power to write \"just\" monetary transactions... (..but we know that people is already \"getting married\" or posting pics of their cat on the BlockChain..) What really matters is that they are \"fixed in time\" (otherwise they would be just useless!). And theres no other \"thing\" on Earth capable of this...

      "Look at the world around you. Look how far we have come as the human race in the past 30 years. We have mobile telepathic devices that can instantly connect to any other human and have access the entirety of human knowledge. The first DNA sequence cost 3 billion dollars and 15 years to complete, today it can be done in a day and cost less than $1000. Solar power total watts installed has been doubling every 2 years since the 1970s[[1]]( Solar power is at 1% total energy production now, but the funny thing about exponential growth though is that at 1% its only 7 doublings from 100%. The future has never been brighter for the human race. This is why we should be celebrating every single use case of the blockchain especially non-financial transaction use cases. Dont fear the use of one of best inventions man has ever devised. Foster its use and let it grow unbounded just like the Internet. Have faith in human engineering that we can keep Bitcoin decentralized even if we have 1TB blocks. I want Bitcoins blockchain one day in the future to be sub 1 second block times and exabyte blocks. Just like GPS coordinates they should get faster and more accurate over time. Our blockchain is beautiful and I want the whole world to use it for millions of use cases no one can even imagine now. If we let it, it will become as important as the Internet and because of its importance there will always be those who fight to keep it decentralized. The small block camp right now is being the over protective parent. Let Bitcoin stand up and try to walk on its own, it might surprise you. Bitcoin has taught us that its always much more resilient than we ever thought.

I love this time of year, all that tax return money floating around, some of it will make its way into BTC and the subsequent price gains will be in part attributed to the halvening which will hopefully get this thing out of control and get us into news media as the wunderkind that BTC is and cause a bit of mania in the later halve of this year.

      "Okay, I know this is probably a stupid question, but considering all the debate around the blocksize lately I feel it deserves mentioning. Is there any reason we couldnt create a \"node pool\" kind of like we have \"mining pools\"? Would it be possible for people to download and share just a fraction of the blockchain, kind of like a torrent, and \"share\" that between other users of the node pool? That way everything is still decentralized, but individual users dont have to take boatloads of disk space to run full nodes (and yes, I know that pruning is coming soon, but what Im suggesting is different). Why cant someone simply \"donate\" a fraction of their diskspace to \"seed\" a fraction of the blockchain?\n",
      "The reluctance of many miners to back forks that increase block size is likely based on profit considerations. Keeping the blocksize small incentives users to pay transaction fees for urgent transactions, which goes right to the bottom line of the miners. This is a good thing, because it increases miners incentive to keep competing by increasing their hash power, which in turn increases forgery protection. Never forget that the giant, ASIC-based hash power behind BTC makes it the most secure digital ledger on this planet, which is the single most important feature holders of BTCs require (if they think about it for minute). The value of BTC increases only as long as people hoard (i.e. hold, i.e remain long) BTC. But when you hoard a medium of exchange over a longer period, security (not convenience) becomes the most important concern. Therefore it is in the best interest of anyone holding BTC and anyone mining BTC to stop supporting forks that increase the blocksize beyond SegWit, especially in light of the coming reward halving. Those who believe BTC is about paying for latte macchiatos at Starbucks should find some worthless \"EasyPeasyCoin\" to spend. Hey, we already got that. Its called dollar.\n",

      "Bitcoin will recover from the current block size crisis. However, the fungibility problem with Bitcoin may be intractable, at least if one is using Bitcoin to transact. However this problem may be mitigated somewhat with side chains. I expect the fungibility drama will play out over many years as the open ledger is something that will make Bitcoin attractive to those who wish to capture it. Lack of fungibility is not something that the average user cares about. In fact, I expect that there will be \"blessed\" side chain implementations that have open ledgers and whose reserve is held by various central banks or the like. Its very important that fungible alt coins (e.g. Monero) thrive, because this will greatly limit the ability of elites to abuse Bitcoin holders and users. Holders will be abused by discounting their holdings as not \"blessed\" and users will be abused by rent seeking activity on the \"blessed side chains\". Sounds a like crap that goes on in our current fiat currency world. On the other hand, if they abuse the Bitcoin holders too much, then the holders can move to fungible alt coins, set up their own side chains and invite the users over as well. In fact, this will not be a one off, but a dynamic process. The absolute opaqueness of a truly fungible alt coin will slow down such a process, but once a truly fungible block chain is seen as trustworthy and a better alternative to Bitcoin, then the process may become unstoppable. After all, users dont care about opaqueness or privacy, they just dont like getting screwed. \n",
      "These are just some observations, based on my attempts to make sense of this mad story that is unfolding before us. Bitcoin at its base layer, the Bitcoin blockchain, is relatively stagnant and closed to innovation. I must stress my use of the word ‘relatively’ here, because of course the Bitcoin protocol of today is indeed different to that of 2009. The fundamentals, however, remain the same. This isn’t a bad thing at all. Gaining consensus necessitates that any changes are uncontroversial, and Bitcoin itself IS consensus, so really it needs to be stable in terms of development. However, the price we pay for this stability is that innovation can be slow. In an environment where failure really isn’t an option, things don’t happen very quickly. This leads to fears that Bitcoin will be displaced by a cryptocurrency with superior features or that banks will create private ‘blockchains’ that are just efficient enough that they condemn Bitcoin to remain in its current niche. I’ve felt it myself, and it’s kind of conflicting. That existential anxiety that because Bitcoin works so well at not being pushed to move in a certain direction, mass adoption will forever elude us. Side chains are exciting as they offer the prospect of a massive wave of innovation around Bitcoin. They also allow institutions who are understandably reluctant to embrace an anarchic cryptocurrency the ability to interact with Bitcoin in a more indirect way. They can create their own tokens, their own rules, and Bitcoin still benefits. This allows for a change of narrative, with institutions able to take the line of “Bitcoin is okay, but we’ve created this awesome side chain that makes it better…” . It aligns the interests of all blockchain development, with those of Bitcoin, as there are huge incentives to develop your block chain as a side chain to the Bitcoin network, with its vastly superior hashing power. I think that when we have working, useful side chains is the point at which it becomes clear to the general public that Bitcoin isn’t just strange internet money backed by some interesting technology that might be useful in banking one day but that Bitcoin is THE blockchain protocol, with all of these amazing features and businesses growing around it. Blockchain and Bitcoin will become synonymous in the public consciousness as these side chains come to fruition. Yes, I know this is highly speculative and I’ve said nothing that hasn’t already been said, I’m sure, but the possible implications of side chains as a step-change in the pace of Bitcoin adoption just really excites me. I’ve glimpsed the possibilities that this trend toward the further decentralisation of blockchain development has opened up. Also, if anybody could expand on the comment I made about side chains being secured by the hashing power of the Bitcoin blockchain that would be great. As I understand it, they have nodes themselves but no miners (as the tokens are not created, rather pegged to Bitcoin at a fixed rate)? I read the white paper a few months back and I’ve watched a few comprehensive Youtube explanations but I’m still not clear on this point.\n",

      "I was thinking of building an arduino for the purposes of secure bitcoin address generation. It would consist of an arduino, accelerometer, and 2 sd card ports. Because it is low-level hardware with no networking capablity and only sd-card based IO, we can trust the platform. You would shake the device for a minute or so to generate a private key. The accelerometer would sample the lowest bit in each of the 3 axis, 100 times a second, then SHA256 the resulting string. The private key would then be output to one SD card (which can be kept securely in cold storage), while the public address would be written to the second SD card.

      "and I couldnt care less whats the average blocksize or its limit. I couldnt care less for block propagation time or blockchain size. I couldnt care less for miners power consumption and heat produced. All I want is the system to work as advertised. Im currently using it and loving it. When Im using Mycelium to scan that BitPay QR on my laptop screen, I get a mini-orgasm when it turns to \"paid\" immediately after I click SEND on my phone. Magic internet money FTW. It doesnt get better than this. So, whatever you do please dont break it. Please dont tell me that tomorrow I will have to wait for some block confirmations or whatever, or that I used the wrong fee, or that there isnt room out there to pay for my customized boobs picture ( I DONT CARE what goes on in the backround. I want it to SIMPLY WORK, as it already is - WORKING. Click SEND, and its on the other end. Dont bother me with anything more than \"write these words somewhere in case you lose your phone, and secure it with some PIN\". Thats it. Your killer app. Click, puf, sent. Pay for anything anywhere instantly, with the added bonus that nobody can block your money. What do I care how many nodes are there? Why would I want to be one? Please, there will always be a number of those to keep the network running. Miners will pay for those if they have to. Banks will set up their own nodes to keep the USER funds safe. Yes, banks. Because why would I, the USER, be bothered with securing my savings. I have my bank for that. With the added bonus that my funds will be banks liability up to a certain, insured, amout. If I have more than that, well, I better invest some time to become my own bank, but general USER shouldnt care. Go to the bank, \"download\" me some bitcoins to my phone and proceed to the bar. Simple. Better yet, once you wake up the next morning, you will know exactly where you spent all your money, even if you dont remember it :D So there you have it. USER is king.

      "Earlier this week, we launched the first version of [Jaxx]( Kryptokits new Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet line. While much of the reaction has been positive, the question I’ve been asked the most is: “is Jaxx open source?” There are a lot of factors involved in determining a product license. Since we launched the Kryptokit Chrome Extension in 2013, all of our products have been completely free to download and use, and have publicly viewable and auditable, non-minified code to ensure that the community knows our software does exactly what it’s supposed to. Currently, Jaxx and all of our products, including the Kryptokit Extension, Rushwallet, and Ethereumwallet.com, do not have a license, meaning we own all of our code. However, we are committed to making Jaxx and all Kryptokit products open source, and will decide on a license by March 7th, 2016. While we are committed to transparency, Kryptokit is a business. It’s a business that has relied on the efforts of many hard-working individuals and hundreds of thousands of dollars in order to get where it is today. I have never taken any outside funding for the project. Choosing the correct license is so crucial - longevity is crucial so that we can keep putting out what we believe to be excellent products. We also need to be able to ensure our proposed monetization strategy stays in tact. Determining the correct open source license can take time. Even with Ethereum, it was a long process, with a lot of debate, and many considerations to weigh before we settled on the licenses Ethereum has today. Over the next few weeks, I plan to speak with representatives from other wallet companies, as well as other industry experts, about the merits of different licensing options and why they chose particular open source models. Until that determination is made, our priority will be on honoring our release schedule and getting Jaxx out to the community quickly and functionally, on all of our planned dozen-plus platforms. Additionally, we plan to have Sergio Lerner and his team perform a full audit ahead of the 1.0 release to ensure our code is up to snuff. Hopefully, this should allay any concerns about our commitment to transparency and serving the wider community, but if anyone has any additional concerns, please let me know.

We started Satoshigallery in 2015 with one idea: let’s make Bitcoin cooler from an iconographic point of view, in order to reach more people and help them embracing Bitcoin values. We love the concept, the philosophy of Bitcoin so much that we want everybody to understand the magic behind it. “Bitcoin is not just a currency, currency is just the first app.” Bitcoin must be viewed from a different perspective to the general public, we have to spark people’s curiosity, open their minds and help them approaching in an easier way. It’s a difficult task, especially when the Bitcoin logo is an orange uppercase B with two vertical bars going through it. That’s why we need art. Because we need to bridge the gap between technical developers/experts/insiders and everyday people - even if they don’t fully understand the tech - who deserve to know that there is something amazing going on for humankind, that can free us all from banks and institutions, and can connect the entire world just in one click. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT? Wed love to have support from the community to fully understand how we can help spreading Bitcoin awesomeness, every suggestion is more than welcome! A daughter of a bit \n",
      "Seems that the political tension around a hard fork to a 2MB block size is mostly centered on two questions. 1. When should it be done? 2. How high should the hashpower activation threshold be? (Im a big supporter of only non-contentious hard forks, as I believe the majority of the ecosystem is as well.) How about this simple solution ? Release a new version of bitcoind (core) that allows MAX_BLOCK_SIZE consensus rule to be 2MB and that activates with a 95% hash power threshold, AND ALSO set a hard date in the code sometime in late 2016 or early 2017 on which it activates anyway, which gives the ecosystem plenty of time to prepare for the upgrade, and gives the ecosystem the opportunity to hard fork any time before the activation date if consensus is achieved organically. BTW, the 4MB block size increase should probably be coded at the same time with the same scheme, activating anyway sometime in 2018, and activating any time before then if 95% hash rate is achieved. No one can claim that theres not enough advanced notice. :) In general, it seems like the core devs of bitcoind can take themselves right out of the political fire by approaching these political tense situations by releasing code, maybe even create parallel releases that differ in soft and hard fork activation schedules (but not consensus rules of course). Then people can run whatever they want and the core devs (or any devs) will never be in the position of quasi-centralized controllers, quasi-policy makers. Its become their defacto job by being the first party in the chain of changes to bitcoin, and it seems like it not great for them or the ecosystem. The network will just reach consensus by people choosing which version of the fork rollout they support. If the bar is always set at 95% of hash power, then the network truly chooses. Easy. \n",

      "Help me with this please, Im having a frustrating debate with a friend who claims that more total supply is worse than less total supply when it comes to a coin. Ill use Ripple as my example. For example: It is a fundamental flaw of Ripple that it has a total supply of 99 billion, versus Bitcoins 21 million. My friends position is that only a single factor (available supply) needs to be taken into account to calculate scarcity & demand, the only thing that matters is that total supply of 34 billion > 15 million, therefore Bitcoin is more scarce and in higher demand. My position is that it is not a flaw of Ripple (or other coins) to have a huge total supply, given that the three factors I consider key are balanced accordingly. It is my position that in order to calculate scarcity & demand, 3 factors need to be taken into account: total supply, available supply and reward rate. You cannot calculate scarcity & demand with only one factor alone. Now lets propose that Bitcoin and Ripple where actually exact clones of each other in terms of utility, code, popularity etc, and the only differences between them are the available supply, total supply and reward rate. And that it is accepted that the price of each coin is currently/will always be scaling relative to the total supply and available supply. In other words, yes, utility and stuff is a factor in this as well, so lets neutral out as many of these added factors as we can by considering them clones in that regard. And naturally 1 Bitcoin is going to be worth more than 1 Ripple if there are only 21 million possible Bitcoins available versus 99 billion possible Ripple available. To give a brief example why I believe that all 3 of those factors need to be taken into account, given the above circumstances: Say we had two coins:  Coin A with a total cap of 1000 coins and an available supply of 100 coins  Coin B with a total cap of 10,000 coins and an available supply of 1,000 coins In his argument, coin A is more scarce than coin B because 100 < 1,000 In my argument, you cannot calculate scarcity based off only those two numbers because you also need to factor in reward rate. Now lets suppose the reward rate is the following:  Coin A has a reward rate of 10 coins per day (reaching total supply exhausted in 10 days, 100/10)  Coin B has a reward rate of 100 coins per day (also reaching total supply exhausted in 10 days, 1,000/100) As such, both coins are equally scarce in my position, but in his position coin A is more scarce because 100 < 1,000. Lets propose that coin B had a reward rate of 200 opposed to 100, and that the total supply would exhaust in 5 days instead of 10. As such, coin B would actually be considered more scarce in this circumstance (in my position), regardless of there being a greater \"total number\" of coins. So given these examples, what is the better investment? What yields the fastest returns, and the biggest returns? I cant give an example on his behalf for his argument because to be honest, it makes no sense to me. Yeah, obviously I understand that 34 billion is a greater number than 15 million, but just looking at that factor alone is means nothing from my perspective. So who is right? \n",

Cryptocurrencies are quite controversional because many people think that the anonymity they offer is dangerous. What do you think, will they change the future for better or worse? Do you think that cryptocurrencies are the future or perhaps only the first step on a road to something bigger?\n",
      "The project [Arnhem Bitcoincity]( has reached a new milestone: There are now 100 venues that accept Bitcoin in Arnhem. The Burger King in the city center is the latest to join the project. For Bitcoin enthusiasts Arnhem is like heaven as you can practically pay everything with bitcoins. You can do your groceries at the SPAR supermarket, you can fill up your car at a local gas station, you can have dinner & lunch at more than 20 restaurants, go to a barber, dentist, massage salon or one of the many shops and pay everything with Bitcoin. And for tourist, there are 5 different hotels and bed & breakfasts where you can stay for the night from budget to high-end. When this project started, all merchants converted their bitcoins to euros immediately through the payment processor BitKassa, but a growing number of merchants now keep their bitcoins, since they can pay some of their supplies with bitcoins themselves at other merchants who accept Bitcoin as well. For instance a restaurant owner who pays for his bread at a bakery that also accepts bitcoins. And this is the ultimate goal of the project: to start a real Bitcoin economy, and prove that a real, viable alternative for the current financial system is possible and actually happening. Burger King Arnhem is owned by a franchisee. Once the owner heard about the Bitcoin project in the city of Arnhem he decided to give it a try. Anyone who pays with bitcoin gets a second Whopper for free. On Friday 19th there will be a Bitcoin Meetup at this Burger King restaurant. Visitors or tourists who are enthusiastic or curious about Bitcoin are more than welcome to [join us]( \n",

      "While doing some recent study for some networking certs I couldnt help but notice the similarities between the challenges we face now with Bitcoin and the challenges we faced when designing things such as Ethernet/IP protocols. One particular example (semi-technical) - Spanning Tree! 99.9% of the worlds networks use this protocol, yet when it was first implemented it was horribly slow and lacked flexibility. After some time, it was clear this protocol needed some adjusting to cope with the real world. Now, rather than abandoning the protocol or making severe adjustments to it cough hard-fork, it was decided to improve the efficiency of the protocol using some ingenuity. Borrow some bits here, use them there, and suddenly we have drastically improved the protocol! To this day, the latest and greatest of STP protocols (yes there are a couple) are still backwards-compatible with the original protocol version. In my humble opinion, I dont think were anywhere near approaching the crisis some people seem to be warning about in relation to the Block size and number of transactions or fees required. Build out the Bitcoin protocol with what were already working with. Make it as efficient and powerful as it can potentially be. Then if all these innovations and features added to Bitcoin still arent enough to meet the growing demands, make safe and necessary changes to cope with these demands. Lets remind ourselves why Bitcoin is so amazing. YOU have full control of YOUR BTC. Nobody can change this, nor can anyone control HOW / WHEN / WHERE you spend your BTC. Remember, Decentralisation is King! Lets not be in a position in 10/20 years time where we reflect and speak of the premature Blocksize changes that could have been avoided. At the end of the day, going from 1MB to 2MB is a 100% increase. Lets see how powerful Bitcoin can become without making changes like this to the protocol. I am very fond of a recent statement that was along the lines of - Its easy to build decentralisation on decentralisation, but difficult to build decentralisation on centralisation. TLDR; Make Bitcoin as efficient and powerful as it can potentially become. Doing a hardfork now is lazy, potentially damaging, and not necessary in my opinion. Decentralisation is King. \n",

What m confused about is how the hackers can then ever spend the btc since the address will be heavily watched. Do they plan to slowly sell over local bitcoins, or are in a country that has less KYC/AML rules and easier to draw out funds?\n",
      "Awesome. I was hoping to avoid having to do this but their latest tactic has left me no choice. Heres the story: I decided to give their site a whirl. Did some research and they seemed to be a legitimate site. So I tossed on $1500 CAD and diversified my profile between some stocks and some altcoins. As well as a couple Bitcoin start up companies. I had put about 90% of my funds into Gold stocks and the rest into other Stocks and commodities. A week goes by and I decided that buying gold stocks at this time is probably a really bad idea, just with the state of the global economy and what not, so I pulled the chute. However, when I tried to withdraw my gold stocks it told.me that I had 2500+ Bitcoins available to withdraw! Obviously this is a mistake, especially when I only put $1500 CAD onto my account. So figuring this was just a temporary glitch, I withdrew anyways, anticipating that the system would correct the mistake or that the sites admins would catch it and deposit my funds back into.my wallet. Boy was I sure wrong! After a couple of days of waiting I decided to send a message to the support staff and inform them of this error and told them I would cooperate in any way possible if they needed me to. No response. A coupe more days go by and I sent another message, asking how things were going. No response. Again, another email. Again, no response. Finally I sent one more plea, asking someone to please reply to my emails because I would very much like my money back. No response. Finally, just now, I went to go log onto their site to see if there had been any changes and these gems decided to completely DELETE my account entirely! This is easily the worst customer service experience of my life. Not only did they flat out ignore me but they stole my Bitcoins and are now trying to sweep this little issue under the rug. Or so it seems? Let me tell you guys, this is not how you invite the masses into this community. I am simply a bitcoin enthusiast, nothing more. Im riding in the curtails of you developers and programmers and spreading the good word when I find something cool. But now these dickbags have tainted my opinion of this community and have left a very bad taste in my mouth. I really hope my Bitcoins were worth the bad rep theyre receiving from this right now. I would avoid doing business with this company at all costs. Theyve demonstrated themselves to be quite the con artists. Hope karma is paying attention. PISS!\n",
      "How can a government tax businesses effectively if they sell their products/services using bitcoins. The same way a lot of business dont accept cards, in order not to pay taxes on some revenues and keep it for them. I know people like bitcoin because its fast, almost fees-less but I think its anonymity and how complicated (money and time consuming for the government to track) makes it very difficult to tax businesses, individuals and tackle thieves and hackers. I can see a lot of pros of bitcoins at the moment, example how people can use it in developing and/or failing states where currency is not stable and the government keeps printing money to suppress its people. My point is bitcoin should always be something on the side where when a government fuck up the people can use it but to use it at the same level we use say USD/EU its gonna be a very big problem because of what I said earlier (a lot of bad people will use it to easily evade taxes, steal etc thus increase in income inequality and making the system less fair than what it is actually right now).\n",

      "So we all know Bitcoin has a TPS limitation of 7 transactions per second due to the 1mb blocksize limitation. With this increasing, it should increase the TPS, but since only an increase to around a maximum of 2mb is viable, its not really going to increase it by a very considerable margin. Especially in comparison to something like a payment gateway. My friend works at a Mastercard payment gateway in Australia and their gateway processes around 150TPS, and thats not a limitation but merely the amount of users theyre processing. So my question is, are you worried about this limitation in terms of adoption for Bitcoin? Because its frequently brought up by Bitcoin haters (and Buttcoiners) as proof that the technology is flawed and will never succeed long term. For example, in a recent conversation I had someone said \"Uber processes 10 riders per second, Bitcoin cant even handle Uber\". So if you arent worried, why not? What are the potential future solutions for this, if any? What is the roadmap in regards to increasing this, if there is one?\n",
      "[link to article]( I am interested to see what the experts think about this kind of tech. As a layman it seems that in the longer run block chain storage will not be particularly important even if the block size increased dramatically. Obviously there are other considerations than just total storage capacity (network speed, etc) but surely this would be useful to increase node decentralisation if the historical block chain can be mass produced and sent physically, with nodes only needing to sync the latest information.\n",
      "I am aware that this may be a stupid question so please be kind :). I am confused about mining difficulty. I understand that it is calibrated so that block validation is done on average every 10 minutes. I also understand that this gives the time for information to propagate through the network, through different type of connection speeds, avoid double transactions etc. But why cant you hardcode a « wait » of 10 minutes, and just use simple hash to validate blocks ? Edit : Thanks.\n",

      "Another powerful argument in Bitcoins favor. The price and volatility of commodities is increased by their usage as money. They are torn between their demand for consumption and their demand to store value. On the other end Bitcoin main usage is to be money. All its other usage are derived from this function. A much bigger Bitcoin market cap might make oil and wheat cheaper. And reduce the money function speculation and fiat currencies hedging of these markets. Making everyone that doesnt own them richer.

      "Since many people with limited server administration experience are likely running Linux servers in order to run Bitcoin nodes: Either update them (`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo reboot` on Debian/Ubuntu - the reboot is important), or shut them down. There is a [serious vulnerability]( affecting almost all Linux systems out there, and if you dont have automatic updates and dont update manually, your server will likely soon be contributing to a botnet instead of the Bitcoin network. (Actually, even if you do have automatic updates, you still may have to reboot for them to take effect fully.) If you dont know what this means and are unable/unwilling to deal with it, shut it down before it becomes a zombie and bites others.\n",

      "Lets assume there was a controversial fork ahead and big cloud mining companies acted only according to their immediate financial profit, allowing the client to pick which option A or B to vote for. I assume in the real world clients might have to pick different cloud miners to get A or B and by far not all mining is cloud mining so the liquidity is not infinite between A and B but to a degree, cloud mining clients can push the vote either way. Now I considered cloud mining as very dangerous given the many scams that happened in the past and the fact that big mining concentration gets bootstrapped by the distributed users that pay for it following economic considerations much like the one Im proposing here but its a fact of life. Now if option B was less popular but an actor wanted it to win for whatever reason, he could pay a small premium to have his cloud mining \"vote\" for it if cloud mining companies werent pricing the options equally anyway. He could give his business to the more expensive competitor until others offered the option, too. The point is that in the early days, mining hardware was a commodity but today hashes are a commodity and this voting is a commodity, too. Hashes are sold for a more or less fixed price, yielding a more or less predictable profit from bitcoin sales. While the promises of profitable hash sales are not always met, its safe to say that voting is essentially free. The voting in a billion dollars economy can today be made at close to zero cost. Im not trying to abolish the voting by hash rate but Id like to raise awareness for this issue, so both sides of the fork consider taking a vote even at a short term loss. I believed that hashing would be done at a direct financial loss once the block rewards faded just like people run TOR nodes for other reasons than immediate profit. With voting actually having value I believe this will happen maybe even earlier than I had thought. \n",

I know most of the wallet data is stored in appdata, but would like to know if just copying that would be enough or if any other files would have to be copied.\n",
      "Theres a list of available games on my profile. I generally ask for 1/4 of the current price of the game on steam (USD) converted to bitcoin. Add me if you want to trade Edit: ok, apparently I have to do some more explaining because people think Im trying to cut and run here. So I have a lot of extra games because I buy a lot of bundles from sites like: www.indiegala.com www.humblebundle.com www.bundlestars.com www.indiegamestand.com www.indieroyale.com And it is pretty frequent that a game appears in more than one bundle. I have been buying bundles for over 2 years now, and I end up with a stockpile of extra keys for games I already have. Some I trade away, some I give to my friends, etc. The reason I chose 1/4 of the current steam price in bitcoin is because a lot of the games I have for trade are ones that other people would have if they also bought bundles, so in order to give people an incentive to use bitcoin, and to help me move more of my cd keys, I settled on 1/4 of the price of the game. So its basically like getting the game on steam sale (75% off) If you also have trading rep on your account or on steamgifts.com, I would gladly go first and allow you to send me the bitcoin after you have verified that the cd key is valid on steam.\n",
      "ok guys, so heres my story. Last week I had been conversing with Coinbase support via twitter because it seems to be the only route that works. Spoke with livechat the one time it was available in my coinbase wallet and he assured me id receive an email. That did not happen, so i was forced to explore other avenues for help. Anyways, i got a tweet from someone who i thought was coinbase, because we had been conversing. here is all our conversations As you can see, he had me do a survey, at the end of the survey send coins to an address to receive double. Wherein lies the problem is that @coinbasesupport replies to their customers via twitter and in the replies section of their page anyone can see who they have been helping. Thats an obvious problem. Scammers now know who coinbase is working with based on their replies, for instance When we tweet them, they should be Direct Messaging us to help. Not helping over social media, especially in regards to bitcoins. Its sad that I felt the only way to get help was via twitter. And i end up getting scammed. Coinbase should stop tweeting their customers, anyone can click on a reply with their made up account with Coinbase Support on the page with whatever @coinbase they want and lure people who have recently been helped. Seems terribly logical, I have opened a case with coinbase, The fake account is now banned. I did receive tweets from two others that this happened to the same way. We are put on a sliver platter, this needs to change. Reply via direct message and not let anyone see who you are helping. They have 500 followers, its not a big social media company. Please, protect us, and do not tweet us with help for others to see. Thank you guys for your time, ill update this as story progresses. \n",
      "Is there an API for historical Bitcoin exchange rate by blockheight? (i.e. I enter blockheight and I get the Bitcoin exchange rate at the time the block was included in the main chain).

There are a lot of other services that provide an exchange rate. Either continuously (e.g. but they dont provide the historical data.

      "I started bitcoind two hours ago and `bitcoin-cli getchaintips` shows this: [ { \"height\" : 398968, \"hash\" : \"000000000000000005dc53c4b3d66f60a7ca0c08aef6ea980ccabad32179af2a\", \"branchlen\" : 117495, \"status\" : \"headers-only\" }, { \"height\" : 281473, \"hash\" : \"00000000000000002d7bc9c9f8976f0251489fc7ef54a271df69a6914703bc37\", \"branchlen\" : 0, \"status\" : \"active\" } ] I think this roughly means that bitcoind has downloaded block headers that are quite current but the actual downloaded blocks are quite behind (height 281473). Eventually the two heights should converge but I dont know how long that will take. Is there anything I can do to speed this up? Im running this on a VPS without any bandwidth problem.

      "Before I start, I want to admit that I am very unknowledgeable on bitcoin in almost every regard, so my perspective is very speculative. Id love to be proved wrong. Bitcoin originally allowed anyone in the world to adopt the infrastructure and share a relatively even probability of solving a block with whatever hardware they had laying around. It very obviously provided the most decentralised means of securing the system, as there was the potential for billions of independent miners to get involved without a pay wall. Arguably, having billions of miners to do less, more decentralised work, has a far greater value for the network and bitcoin as a whole, but unfortunately, thats not what is going on, and theres not a whole lot of talk against what is. What we have instead, and scarily similar to the world government economy a lot of us are trying to escape from, is a small number of wealthy individuals who have complete power over the rest of the world, and whose fortune is increasing because of their existing stranglehold. In fact, the bitcoin system ENCOURAGES this by the means of the coinbase fee, which not only makes those individuals richer, but further forces out casual, everyday spenders, by increasing the adoption cost of mining to help secure their own assets. What makes it even worse, is that weve already witnessed the politics of our open-source currency and been put into a scenario of having to vote the future of it. As far as Im aware, this isnt as simple as just running a wallet node to show your support for a specific change, as hashing power is being used to measure opinion, and is obviously more far more valuable as such. So for some crazy reason, weve got the big bitcoin mining operators (who are already holding back the mass adoption of small-scale, decentralised mining), investing to ensure they make the most money over their \"competitors\" (via their hashing power (money)), who have ultimate control and ability to change the entire system in whatever way they see fit, even if it doesnt conform to the original vision of bitcoin or the average user. Worse yet, a system that could originally be run casually on billions of computers without any regard for cost, is now at the hands of people who are only interested in how much they can earn. Bitcoin COULD be totally free of fees if everyday spenders subsidised them via simply running a miner in the background and increasing their electricity cost insignificantly, but as things currently stand, the entire functional payment system is costing a few people a lot of money that they will undoubtedly want back because they treat bitcoin as a business. Does this not bother anyone else? I cant understand why people are not up in arms about this massive hole were continuing to dig ourselves into. Everyone in the world could, and should do their part to run the network, yet the typical comments I read are along the lines of paying companies to run it for us. Why is this even a thing?\n",
      "So Im a VFX/Digital artist and Im developing a youtube series/channel. Im very interested in using bitcoin to earn revenue from the videos but more importantly I just want to earn income from my channel doing what I love so that maybe one day I can quit my day job. Now given the fact that Im tied to other projects at the moment I dont have a lot of time to work on it and, also, Im going to probably make around 8+ videos before I release the first one. So its going to be 6+ months from now before I even will release the first episode. I have a lot of time to wait and see. So there has been a lot of drama lately around bullshit copyright claims at Youtube and I personally have been effected on a youtube channel that I help run. Luckily its a non-for profit so we havent lost money just maybe 100,000+ views because of it. To make a long story short we bought the rights to some music out of our own pockets but another company is claiming it is their (version)songs when its not. Over a month later we have yet to communicate with a human being at youtube but in the mean time we have been blocked on all mobile devices on earth. And unfortunately since were just a bunch of guys who only do this on the side as a hobby we cant afford a lawyer to fight this bullshit claim thats in another country. Given that Ive seen a bunch of big youtubers come out and talk about this and my own personal experience with this, its making me really scared to try and start my own channel even though I should be steering really clear of copyright infringement. The youtube claim system is currently set up to be seriously abused by people. Also given the fact that youtube recently ended changetip tipping in the comments it seems they arent so friendly to bitcoin at the moment. Which is more reason to be afraid So anyways I was thinking that I would monetize with ads on youtube and then also have a QR code at the end of each video for tipping. However today I seen popchest.com on r/bitcoin which seems like a great idea however there is clearly a lot of details that need to be worked on and developed. Like $0.25 is way to expensive if its pay per view it should be like a cent or less. My opinion isnt super relevant but heres some features that would be on my wishlist for a website like this.  All videos (or videos selected by the channel) are free but with compulsory adverts so creators can still earn money from views.  If you subscribe to a channel it automatically charges your wallet once, and only once, for each new video you watch on said channel. However all adverts are completely removed from the channel you subscribe to as well as the ability to view restricted content.  Creators can choose whatever subscription fee they want. $0.01 or $5 per video. Completely up to the creator. Obviously you would need safe guards such as subscribes agreeing to new fees and such. I think a system like that would also force advertisers to be more competitive and pay more for their advertising which = more money for content creators. However I dont know of a website thats been around long enough that I can really trust for this. I mean at this point I can wait awhile to publish anything if that means having a website like this. TL;DR Should I make a youtube channel with tipping address in the videos or wait for websites like popchest to develop?\n",

I assume that signing up via his page would have given him a referral bonus. Anybody new to Ponzi schemes should realize that while returns can be made in the short term, ALL Ponzi schemes eventually fail. The vast majority of participants lose their money.

      "The biggest fallacy that I very frequently read about is: Visa can do 20000[1] transactions-per-second, Bitcoin can do 3! [2] The problem is that such a comparison is completely inadequate. To truly understand why it is so requires some understanding of distributed systems and databases, so I cant really blame most people. Bitcoin is a system that has no trusted third party. The arbiter for deciding what transactions made it, and in what order is elected every 10 minutes. This is the solution to the double spend problem: an arbiter. An arbiter will say: fuck you Bob, youre trying to pay two different e-commerce websites with the same 10 Bitcoin. Now, it turns out that when you have a system that has to elect arbiters based on proof of work, you have to sacrifice time (latency). That your transaction made it to a single valid mined block is not actual evidence that its actually likely to stay that way. Miners can mine blocks at the same time. Miners can out-speed other miners. This is a concern surfaced to Satoshi only a few days after the initial announcement. This is what he had to say for the situation where two \"sides\" of the truth are mined: > The nodes working on each side will be trying to add the transactions that are missing from their side. When the next proof-of-work is found, whichever previous block that node was working on, that branch becomes longer and the tie is broken. > Its not a problem if transactions have to wait one or a few extra cycles to get into a block. > If you know about distributed systems, the property were vaguely referring to here is \"consistency\". What we want is all members of the system to share a single view of what happened, a single chain. In the case of Bitcoin, the consistency is probabilistic. A zero-confirmation transaction has VERY low probability of being \"true\" because it can be double spent. After 5 or 6 blocks (50 or 60 minutes), its strongly consistent. Back to Visa. Visa has a single arbiter: Visa. No computer in Visa is positioned adversarially to other computers (like miners are against potential attackers). There are no disputes, no branching, no multiple versions of the chain floating around with different transactions in it. Visa itself is probably a distributed system made up of many computers, obviously, but those computers have a simple consensus protocol: they talk to each other in the same network, probably in the same room of the same datacenter. The transaction velocity is thus whatever it takes for Visa to receive your transaction, communicate it to all their computers in their own private network(s), and then confirm it back to you. This is called strong consistency. After Visa tells a merchant your money went through, its a fact. How fast can this be? If we look at the latency numbers that every engineer has to know ( sending a packet from The Netherlands to California and back takes 150 miliseconds. If youre paying for something in The Netherlands, you might get a strongly confirmed transaction in their system in under a second. Even if Bitcoin increases the block size to A PETABYTE, it CANT POSSIBLY COMPETE! So why do we like Bitcoin? Because Visa can be shut down by a government. Because a government can order Visa to block you. To seize your money. To not allow the type of good youre trying to sell. They can change the rules or fees on you. They can modify their own database. Wipe your balance. Edit it. Increase their own. The price of getting all those things is latency. Its people spending electricity as a proof of their worthiness as a temporary arbiter of the system. Its that even after a block contains your transaction, its not for sure its settled. Lets say you want to buy a coffee with Bitcoin. Do you really need the amount of truth Bitcoin provides? Do you really need it to be mined, with the cost it incurs in to do so? Probably not. It makes sense to pay a higher fee for something so costly. Eventually, Im sure Bitcoin will handle a lot of transactions per second while remaining highly decentralized. Block sizes will increase. But most of this \"anxiety\" over increasing it is misguided, specially when Bitcoin is compared with a system completely unlike it, with different priorities.

I understand the consensus announcement is not truly consensus; it is signed by some important parties, but not everyone. I would strongly encourage Core to add the following (however properly worded) to their formal roadmap document, and make a public announcement about the same: >The code for the hard-fork will therefore be available by July 2016. If there is strong community support, the hard-fork activation will likely happen around July 2017. Were close... And lets please keep the discussion civil, we must at least endeavor to that.

      "Im aware that Satoshi alluded to a day when there would be larger CPU \"farms\". I dont know that he was necessarily talking about Steve, Sally, and Mark bowing to the powers and personal financial opinions of Chang, who would then singlehandedly influence the code, direction, timelines, and feature set of the bitcoin protocol itself. All on his own. With a few others like him. But thats whats happening. So Im not completely sold on the fact that Satoshi actually did envision, or even endorse what we know today as pools. So lets get that out of the way up front. So should pools even exist? Its great that we came to a decision this week. But it was only a few individuals. No matter how you look at it, that was not a decentralized consensus. So tell me why pools are mandatory in Bitcoin. And why they arent a complete bastardization of the entire concept of decentralization? Maybe 1 CPU = 1 Vote isnt possible anymore. But these monopolies are a danger to this technology, for obvious reasons. Anyone who denies that has already eaten from the apple of \"power\" and doesnt want to give it up. The rest of us know this is an accurate statement. At the very least, pool owners should be giving individual votes to their miners, and be forced to act based on the decision of their miners. Creating a pool with any other mentality is a direct contradiction to the entire concept of this decentralized technology. If thats not going to happen, maybe the protocol itself should somehow abolish pools altogether? Just opening this up for discussion. \n",

      "Machine learning algorithms have started revealing inherent behavioral patterns that are influencing our decisions.

Is it reasonable to believe that a company (regardless the company name) is unable to build something without influencing it to behave outside the natural behavior of what the technology needs to do in order to survive. In the video Dr Osborne reaches a point where he speaks about judges and leniency (23:30 in) and how their behavior is shaped by daily rituals. Is the blockchain something that can survive if development feeds towards a financially rewarding business model, even with the best intentions at heart? Honestly looking for a discussion here, not necessarily a conspiratorial flamewar, although with the opening I suppose I am towing a tight line.

These forces, though it gradually becomes more difficult, will continue to attempt to paint a picture of consensus for a contentious hard fork that simply doesnt exist (outside one or two misinformed CEOs).

      "Hello. Im currently about to purchase my first Bitcoin (or part of a bitcoin) and I need some advice as to which of the two apps I should buy it through. I currently have an account on both Circle Pay and Coinbase and here is my opinion on the two: Circle Pay has no fees (from at least what Ive seen) but Coinbase has a 1 dollar fee per 100 dollars or so. Also, Circle Pay only always .68 Bitcoin to be bought per week but Coinbase allows $100 a day (from bank account to bitcoin.) I wont be purchasing $100 a day that often, but I dont like the limits on either one. Im aware that you can extend the limits, which I have applied for, but I dont know how long that will take. TLDR; Circle Pay vs Coinbase on Android, which one is better for buying Bitcoin? (I will be purchasing amounts usually from $100+) EDIT: I also was wondering why both of these apps have different values for 1 BTC. I noticed Circle Pay was at $444 while Coinbase was at around $438. EDIT 2: If Im using Coinbase, at what amount should I be using the Vault rather than my wallet? Im currently thinking about putting $400 into bitcoin but I dont know if I should be putting that in the wallet or the vault.\n",
      "I have a plan but Im not sure if it is even possible. I have two questions, but first some background: I am trying to figure out a way to fund a 6 month period of time in San Francisco. This will start with a 3 month period of time in a web development bootcamp, followed by my job search. I have two credit cards, an old Chase card and a new one which has a 0% introductory APR for period of time. I want to access the money via the 0% purchase APR on my new credit card, without paying the 4% fee charged for handing out cash... Anyway here are my two ideas. 1.) I was thinking about buying bitcoin with my new card (should be 0% I believe) and avoiding the 4% cash advance fee. 2.) In order to pay off my credit cards every month (to avoid damaging my credit as well as avoiding any interest on my old C/C) I am thinking about paying off one credit card with the other every month. Effectively switching where my balance is held every month. The problem is both my credit cards (yes even the new one) have a balance transfer fee of 2% which would really add up after 6 months of balance transfers back and forth... That is unless I pay off my balances each month using bitcoin purchased @ 0% on my new credit card. I am new to bitcoin - so is this even possible? After doing some digging it seems the at least one exchange (cex.io) charges a 3.5% fee on credit card purchased bitcoins - effectively killing my idea at least with that exchange... I was also looking at xapo.coms card as a way to transfer bitcoin back to dollars. Anybody have any comments, ideas, or input? \n",

I mean, I dont run any kind of mining, so the only way I get Bitcoin is to purchase it with a card or my bank account.

Decentralized, anonymous, and powered by the laws of math which wont lie, cheat, or become power hungry and fuck you over. It just does what its meant to do. Right? To my limited understanding, there is some conflict. The bitcoin guys seem to disagree on some things. Now, Im not technical. I just barely understand whats happening under the hood of bitcoin. But I expect it to work. And hopefully for years to come. In other words, Im the average stupid user. Im the average stupid user because Im dealing with other complicated things in my life, and I prefer to avoid adding to the mess. Actually, Im hoping to be able to use Bitcoin to decrease the mess, by making currency less complicated, more free, and generally just better. So to the wizards who make this work: What does the future look like for bitcoin? Can you make it alright? Can you stop the conflict? Remember, the average stupid user still contributes - just by participating. If it is too hard or unstable for us, we cant participate. Unless this is not for us.

      "First, Context: Brian is a co-founder of Coinbase, one of the more significant Bitcoin service companies in our ecosystem. Coinbase provides wallet services for its users that allow them to buy and sell Bitcoin, and send Bitcoin to other Bitcoin users. Brian has been an outspoken proponent of Bitcoin Classic and for a HF to provide larger blocks in general. This would avoid a premature fee market in Bitcoin (in his view), and is important for Bitcoin adoption and for the Bitcoin ecosystem. For this, many have attacked Brian and have made quite a number of accusations about the influence of large corporate interests on Bitcoin. Any simplifications or errors in the above are all mine. I just wish to set the context of this post. Brian owes Bitcoin Core a Big \"Thank You\" We have now had steady blockchain congestion for nearly 3 weeks. That is going to continue (and get worse) over coming months. People are going to find Bitcoin transactions require larger fees, and will take longer to confirm, and perhaps will have to boost fees to make transactions go into blocks (RBF). This situation makes point of sale (which everyone has said is insecure with 0 confirmations) way, way, way worse. Because even innocent, willing to pay customers using Bitcoin and paying in Bitcoin at a fee that should ensure the transaction goes into a block, may not get a transaction in a block. But what if there was a company that could make that safe? A company that provides wallets to users, and provides payment processing to merchants? Like Coinbase? As Bitcoin sheds uses cases of casual transactions by users to buy stuff, centralized solutions implemented by Corporate entites like Coinbase, Circle, Bitpay, GoCoin, and others can pick up the slack. They can use (perhaps) settlement layers provided by companies like Blocksteam to move Bitcoin value among themselves off blockchain. Now our user can be happy! With a Coinbase(tm) wallet, they can pay their Merchant with a Coinbase Payment Interface (tm) to pay their bill in Bitcoin and know that the payment will be received! And no Transaction Fee! Brian in self interest should want this. I dont see any direct benefit of larger blocks for Coinbase. They dont need lots of transactions. It is users that do. We Owe Brian a Bit of Respect So Id say we owe him a little respect. You may disagree with him, and he could even be totally wrong about Classic as a solution to the Bitcoin congestion we have now. But he isnt thinking about the narrow self interests of Coinbase, nor is he promoting a solution that has some immediate and obvious advantage for Coinbase; quite the opposite. The advantage to Coinbase is that he wants Bitcoin to succeed. For the ecosystem to thrive. For personal wallets to thrive. Right or wrong, this is a principled stance. I heartily support the debate against his proposals and against Classic. And I will appreciate every downvote of my observations here. But I for one wish to go on record against the thread that anyone in his debate (Core or anyone else) is doing anything but looking out for Bitcoin.\n",

      "When I hear core developers talk about scaling bitcoin I hear things like: \"We have to use the space we have intelligently first. Raising the block size will never be enough.\" and \"Approaches like the lighning network will make it possible to use the space much more efficiently\". I think this is misleading in some way.. It sounds like bitcoin core has many ideas for how to scale bitcoin without raising the block size and lightning is one of them. No... the core developer team is all in for the lightning network. Of course they proposed segregated whithness and maybe some other fine tunes which would all be nice additions for a blocksize increase.. but they dont want that increase. 2mb in 2017.. thats really the lowest value they could negotiate with the chinese mining industry. So what about the lighning network, will it work? Theoretically.. yes - but in reality.. not going to happen. Lightning adds a lot of complexity and also exposes the user to some more complexity. \"Do i send my money to a bitcoin address now? Or to a lightning network address?\" \"Does the person i send money to has to be online now while i send it? \", \"I just want to send money :/\"... But on the enduser side the level of complexity added is nothing compared to the level of complexity added to all implementations that use bitcoin right now. It will be a punch in the face for everyone who implemented something and now has to change everything. It is hard to change the habits of a whole group. The bigger the group the harder and the bitcoin community is already too big for such a crucial change. If the core team will persist on lightning as THE scaling solution people will eventually just wander off to e.g. ethereum. If they will not persist on lightning then they will have to increase the blocksize anyway, the only reason to not do it now is to try to push such a crucial change for the ecosystem through. In the end it will not work but only slow down the growth of adoption. So dont be too impressed by some geeks telling you how to first fine tune the system and then look for alternative solutions. Dont oversee the obvious elephant in the room.. Who would profit of lightning? \n",

      "\"Q - The Bitcoin community claim they have created money without government if they live within the Bitcoin system. What’s your reaction to this claim? A - But you cannot live within the Bitcoin system. It’s impossible. Sure, you can buy bitcoins with your dollars and fool some people into thinking you’re living on bitcoins. But you’re not. To manage it, you need a circular flow of income, and with bitcoins, there is none. Every time you purchase something with bitcoins, as soon as the sellers of the goods and services turn it over to Coinbase or Bitpay to convert it back to dollars or pounds, each purchase becomes a sale of bitcoins. That way, no one’s holding this stuff. Equally, when you look at the real statistics, you find that a lot of the numbers the Bitcoin faithful claim as usage, are outright phony. The faithful say there are 110,000 transactions a day, but only about a thousand of those transactions are for the buying and selling of goods and services. The rest are miners moving bitcoins between different wallets and address, and gambling. On top of that, there is what’s called “the change factor” which means each transaction gets counted twice. Next, the faithful say, there are eight million wallets. What they don’t tell you is that almost all of them are either empty or near-empty. In truth, Coinometrics at Cambridge says that fewer than 250,000 wallets hold one bitcoin or more. That’s not 250,000 people, that’s wallets, and most people have multiple wallets. Based on that, I am correct when I say, there are more people who are members of the Kuwait Airways frequent flier club than there are people on the planet holding bitcoins.\" \n",

      "We have been excited and anxiously waiting for this for almost two years, waiting for development to finish, and Ledger has finally brought it to us! Wallet integration into a secure trusted element built right into your phone, which makes your wallet app almost as secure as having a dedicated hardware wallet! Some background and explanation first: Many years ago ARM, the company that makes most of the CPUs running in Android smartphones, has implemented something called TrustZone, or TEE (trusted execution environment), which is a completely separate processor sitting next to the main CPU, which has its own memory, display, and input. Its basically a whole separate computer. The original intent was to have banks use it for increased security instead of relying on logins and passwords. But banks didnt care, so that chip has sat there, in everyones phones, doing nothing. Until Ledger came along! They wrote a small wallet interface that loads into that TEE chip, and does all the key storage and signing there. So far it works with Mycelium and Green Address (for Android). The way it works is, when you install and set it up, the applet is loaded into the secure chip, and the chip goes through the process of generating HD private keys. These keys NEVER leave that chip. Then Mycelium Wallet gets the public portion of that HD wallet that lets it manage your accounts (xpub). When you create a new transaction, Mycelium checks your balances, creates the transaction, opens a secure encrypted channel to the TEE chip, and sends that transaction to it. When the TEE receives a transaction request, it opens a new screen, on top of your Android OS screen, so its impossible to fake, and asks, \"Hey, what is this, and what do you want to do with it?\" You have to physically tell the chip that you do want to approve of that transaction, at which point the transaction is signed directly on the TEE and sent back to Mycelium Wallet, which then broadcasts it to the network. This is basically the equivalent of having a hardware wallet connected to your phones USB port at all times, but built right into your phone. And nothing, not rooting, hacking, or physically accessing your phone (short of guessing your pin) will allow an attacker access to your private keys. Its as Ive been saying, in the future we will go from phones that run software apps, to secure cryptographic devices that also run a phone app, and the future is now! The link to download Ledgers applet us here: Unfortunately it only works on some phones right now (mainly newer Samsungs), but more and more phones will be added over time. I have been using this thing since September for hundreds of transactions, and never had a problem (Im a terrible beta tester, not being able to find any bugs), and its great being able to carry any amount of coins without worry!\n",
      "One of the common arguments against a HF to increase the block size is that there are benefits to establishing a transaction fee market. Wouldnt smaller blocks help to accelerate the growth of a fee market? For this reason, why arent those opposed to a block size increase advocating for a block size decrease? Heres a formulated argument: Premise 1 Some people view higher transaction fees as a good thing, ceteris paribus. Premise 2 Lower block sizes create demand for higher transaction fees, ceteris paribus. Conclusion Therefore, to increase transaction fees, it is reasonable that some people should agree that the block size should be lowered, ceteris paribus.\n",
      "I know the 10 minute goal for confirmations helps keep the bitcoin network secure. But with the current total hashing power of the bitcoin network, I dont understand why it cant be changed to a 5 minute goal. If you halved the confirmation time, and halved the reward schedule, it would still work out to mining the last bitcoin in the year 2140, just like it is in the current setup. In July of this year the reward is going to halve from 25 to 12.5 every 10 minutes (on average). When that happens, they can change it to every 5 minutes and 6.25 BTC. Thats still the same 12.5 every 10 minutes. And the block size (for the time being) wouldnt have to change from 1 MB to 2MB, because there would be twice the blocks for 10 minutes worth of transactions. \n",

      "Unfortunately some merchants hold an extra amount above and beyond the price of the purchase. I have encountered this at bars/restaurants and hotels, but also when using the Shift Card to make online purchases. (This is the protocol with other debit/credit cards too). So if I purchase something for $1000, the temporary hold ends up being $1200. The following day, the final correct charge amount gets settled, and $200 gets returned via Shift (to my Coinbase account). The problem is that I receive $200 worth of BTC, rather than the same amount of BTC that was \"held\". If (when) the price fluctuates overnight, I stand to gain or lose actual BTC in the process - ie: .5 BTC (worth $200) gets held, but price changes overnight and .4 BTC (worth $200) gets returned. I realize its Visa thats sending the $ back to my Shift/Coinbase account (accounting in $ of course) but I wonder if it could be expected to have Shift/Coinbase providers cover this and reconcile the hold release in BTC and return the original amount of BTC rather than $? or maybe this is a worse idea? or maybe give customers the option? just thinking out loud & wondering about others experiences with this.

      "I posted [this]( the other day over on /r/bitcoinbeginners. tl;dr: I have some coins I mined years ago, decided a few weeks ago to put them in Coinbase to cash some of the money out and use a few BTC to play with day trading on their exchange.

      "Theres been a lot of talk about what happens when the block reward diminishes. One motivation for not increasing the block size is to create a fee market because even if such a market is not necessary now, it will be necessary in the future, and why not start now?--so goes the argument. Im skeptical of the argument. Miners revenue is essentially the volume of transactions multiplied by the average fee per transaction. Capping the block size surely increases the fees. However, it caps the volume. A bigger block size decreases the fees, but allows a greater volume. Small blocksize: volume x FEES Large blocksize: VOLUME x fees Why yields greater revenues? Its not apparent to me, and I doubt anyone knows this answer in advance. It might very well be that miner revenue is maximized with a huge block size such that fees are very, very low (say 5 satoshis) and the number of transactions are very, very high. There may be good arguments to cap the block size as a way to promote decentralization. But maximizing miner revenues does not seem like a good argument for limiting the block size.\n",

      "I think Ive figured out a solution to the whole debate. Forgive me if someone has already thought about this, I havent had my hands in the weeds, but I think this would satisfy all of the camps - it maintains decentralization, its secure, and will still allow more transactions to be processed without including the block size. sort of. Background ---------- Core wants to avoid centralization (by concentrated hashing/latency issues) by keeping the blocksize low Classic/Unlimited/XT wants to avoid centralization by raising the block size limit so that transactions arent at the mercy of centralized settling authorities. I believe both are right in their own way. Solution -------- The solution is to figure out how to process more transactions without making the blocks so big that latency isnt an issue. It seems that right now, blocks are processed sequentially, and they need to, to be hashed and added to the ledger. i.e. : Block 1 (1mb) ---> Block 2 (1mb) ---> Block 3(1mb) --->.... The problem is the situation were in right now. My proposal would be to have two-dimensional blocks. i.e. : Block 1,1 (1mb) \\ \\ Block 2,1 (1mb) \\ \\ Block 3,1 (1mb) \\ Block 1,2 (1mb) \\ Block \\ Block 2,2 (1mb) \\ Block \\ Block 3,2 (1mb) \\ Block Block 1,3 (1mb) / 1 / Block 2,3 (1mb) / 2 / Block 3,3 (1mb) / 3 Block 1,4 (1mb) / / Block 2,4 (1mb) / / Block 3,4 (1mb) / Miners would now choose which sub-block 1 to hash (\",1\"; \",2\"; \",3\"; \",4\" etc) to hash - each sub-block would still take ~10 minutes, but they would all be hashed concurrently. Once hashed, the network takes the 4 (in this example) hash values and then hashes them to finalize/seal the combined block. This way, were still only propigating 1-2mb blocks, were just doing a few of them concurrently. This futher increases decentralization and helps the network scale. Depending on the volume of transactions in the previous 100 or so blocks, the number of sub-blocks will be dynamically adjusted. Im proposing 120% of the average of the last 100 blocks to always leave room for more, without leaving too much room for spam transactions. This would allow the network to dynamically scale. Clients would know how many sub-blocks there are available in the next couple of blocks (based on above), so clients would randomly assign their transactions to 2-3 sub-blocks. This ends up being a confirmation of sorts - something confirmed in more than one sub-block should be more secure. This also helps reduce the instance of orphaned transactions. Thoughts?\n",

      "As good libertarians, most of us like the sound of a \"fee market\". It implies that fees are not set by a political committee, but decentrally determined by economic forces. In an ideal market, Adam Smiths famous invisible hand pushes prices towards marginal costs as supply and demand adjust accordingly, thereby setting incentives right for the optimal use of the available resources. No central planner could possibly do better. Unfortunately, the \"fee market\" frequently mentioned on /r/bitcoin is far from this ideal. Whereas demand can indeed adjust, supply is subject to an arbitrarily imposed limit. Such a limited \"fee market\" is closer to a planned economy than to a free market. In order to get closer to the libertarian ideal, supply must be allowed to adapt. As long as this is not the case, speaking about a \"fee market\" is a misleading half-truth. Some more economic details: one way to seemingly solve this is [\"flex cap\" by Mark Friedenbach]( However, all the currently discussed proposals do is replacing the centrally planned fixed cap with a centrally planned supply curve. Instead, a mechanism driven by the actual costs of running the network should be chosen, which is a tricky and so far unsolved problem. The best approximation so far is [BIP 100]( which allows miners to vote on the block size. From an economic perspective, the voting mechanism of BIP 100 allows miners to enforce a cartel, charging monopoly prices. Driven by economic interests, they will set block sizes such that their collective long-term profits are maximized. Even though this is not ideal, this would already be much better than any fixed cap. Edit: corrected BIP number\n",
      "Currently, all bitcoin holders are paying miners via subsidy/inflation for the security of the network, so that we get the most secure blockchain, without them having to raise fees. One could argue that this aligns with the interest of bitcoin holders as low fees onboard more users, thus making bitcoin exponentially more useful through the network effect and consequentially more valuable. Yet, [core developers]( want to see a fee market emerge ~~ASAP~~. Because we may actually need it in 10+ years? If core argues technically against a blocklimit increase, Im on their side if push comes to shove. But this doesnt make sense to me. Theres a reason companies offer 30 day free trials of their product. Or that my ISP charges a lower price in the first year for new customers. Bitcoin is only useful if people use it.

      "Couple of highlights > Bitcoin Core 0.12 introduced a new blocksonly setting. When set to blocksonly a node behaves normally but sends and receives no lose transactions; instead it handles only complete blocks. There are many applications for nodes where only confirmed transactions are interesting, and a node which still verifies and forwards blocks still contributes to network health-- less, perhaps, than one that relays transactions: but it also consumes fewer resources to begin with. An additional downside they dont get the latency advantages of signature caching since every transaction they see is totally new to them-- this isnt something miners should use. > How much less bandwidth does blocksonly use in practice? I recently measured this using two techniques: Once by instrumenting a node to measure bandwidth used for blocks vs all other traffic, and again by repeatedly running in both modes for a day and monitoring the hosts total network usage; both modes gave effectively the same result. >> How much is the savings? Blocksonly reduced the nodes bandwidth usage by 88%. > A significant implication of this is that any scheme for bandwidth reduction which works by using already relayed transactions to reduce the size of transmitted blocks can _AT MOST_ reduce the overall bandwidth usage by 12%-- assuming that differential compression achieved an \"infinity-fold\" improvement. > Why does relay use so much bandwidth? The fundamental reason for this is because relay in the Bitcoin Protocol is linear in the number of transactions and the number of peers. (E.g. bandwidth is a function of Transactions  Peers). >One possible scheme Ive been discussing (and working on) for a while is mempool reconciliation. >> The idea is this, at random intervals a node will ask one of its peers for a sketch of the top X MBytes of its mempool. In its request it could also signal that its interested only in transactions whos ancestor feerate is over some minimum threshold, along with information about the size and feerate of its own mempool. The returned sketch is an IBLT of some size estimated by the sender based on the information sent by the requester. >> Unlike the efficient block transmission IBLT proposals, this IBLT only transmits transaction IDs-- which will avoid the fragmentation overhead needed in sending whole transactions. >> The requester then attempts to reconstruct the IDs using the content of its own mempool. If it is unable to reconstruct all of the IDs, it requests from another random peer with a different seed. >> When the node has multiple IBLTs it can use the partial solutions from each of them to help solve the other ones. >> As it learns new txids that it was previously unaware of it then fetches them via getdata. When it completes a reconstruction it can INV any missing transactions towards the peers that didnt have them. >In any case, this scheme would avoid the quadratic-like behavior of relay bandwidth. It would let nodes trade latency off vs relay overhead, and it would allow for a graceful way of handling the highest priority transactions first. -- transactions a dozen or more blocks deep in the mempool are not going to get mined any time soon, so if they have lower relay latency from reconciling them less frequently that is no great harm. I believe it could do so without substantial increases in vulnerability to attack. The same software infrastructure could also be used for bandwidth minimized block transfer for nodes that do have mempools (otherwise blocksonly gives optimal bandwidth gains), though latency minimization is much better accomplished via techniques like Matts efficient block relay protocol-- since the most important thing to minimize latency is to minimize roundtrips.

Thanks in advance everyone, would really appreciate some help on this cos its stressing me out hardcore ill btc tip any1 $40 if they can definitively help me solve this problem\n",
      "I have an idea for smart contract usage that will hopefully provide a cryptographically verifiable protocol-level functions that have a wide range of uses. NOTE: I am not fully aware of the capabilities of smart contracts on their various platforms, but the basic principle of this idea can still stand while the technicalities get worked out __Purpose: To limit the amount of bitcoin leaving particular addresses on the protocol level (using smart contracts and their capabilities) which, in the case of a hotwallet/privatekey compromise, limits the total amount stolen to a function of time.__ Let me begin with a theoretical use case: An exchange has 100 BTC in their hotwallet distributed evenly across 10 addresses, so each address has a balance of 10BTC in each. The system providing rate spending-rate limiting could be as follows (But if anyone has any other ways, possibly already existing, to implement rate limiting, feel free to chime in) There is a smart contract in place that does the following: Only one address may create withdrawal transactions at a time within a the timeframe of a block, and if there exist transactions coming from two or more of the ten addresses, the transactions become invalid and all the funds from the 10 addresses are sent to a hardcoded coldwallet address, stopping any further withdrawals. The exchanges withdrawal system is set up so that there is never an instance where it would spend from more than one address at a time, so if that happens there is either a misconfiguration or, more importantly, a hotwallet compromise. If a hacker does manage to compromise the hotwallet, two following things could happen: • The hacker is unaware of the smart contract’s rules and immediately tries to spend all the coins to a an address he controls, triggering the hardcoded coldwallet transaction because there are more than one address out of the 10 spending coins within a single block • The hacker is aware of the smartcontract, so is limited to withdrawing a maximum of 10 BTC per block, making it so that the amount she/he can steal is limited to the amount of blocks found in the period of time before his detection. As soon as the exchange becomes aware of unauthorized transaction(s), they can force a two-address spend and force all the coins to be sent to a cold wallet address in their control. If the exchange’s withdrawal volume exceeds the limit of 10 BTC per block, they can create a new contract that increases that amount. Worst case scenario, the exchange will be able to cryptographically prove that the coins do exist and it provably only a matter of time (measured by blocks found). The benefits of this system can stretch beyond just security. One can limit their spending habits on the protocol level, and in the case of one needing to be able to withdraw more than the predetermined limit, there could be services in place that, for a small percentage, offer you instant cash for a ntimelock transaction that guarantees the receipt of funds at a certain block height. I hope this makes sense, let me know if you have any questions. Please, if you have anything to improve upon at all, please mention it. I hope there’s not some fundamental flaw I’m missing. -MB\n",

      " The Currency app requires nearly instantaneous confirmation of each transaction.  It is not the case that the existing Bitcoin system provides nearly instantaneous confirmation for each transaction.  Therefore, the existing Bitcoin system is not the Currency app. Fortunately, the existing Bitcoin systems capabilities are probably enough to allow for simulating the Currrency app to a nearly arbitrary degree of accuracy; the existing system forms a self-contained, coherent protocol for settlement on which another, higher-level protocol can be built to provide to BTC the properties of currency. This is not a competing vision; this is not a re-imagining of Bitcoin. BTC is a unit of account. Bitcoin is a settlement layer. The Lightning Network is a currency layer built on top of Bitcoin; the Lightning Network turns BTC into a currency. Currency is but one app that can be developed on top of a settlement system; Bitcoin as a settlement layer has been discussed since the dawn of Bitcoin.  [Satoshi on 30 September 2010]( > As you figured out, the root problem is we shouldnt be counting or spending transactions until they have at least 1 confirmation. 0/unconfirmed transactions are very much second class citizens. At most, they are advice that something has been received, but counting them as balance or spending them is premature. That is, your transaction doesnt mean much until the Bitcoin network begins to settle it in the blockchain. Since early on, people were discussing all manner of ways to make confirmations faster, including changing the rate at which blocks are confirmed; people realized that waiting for settlement wasnt going to work well for using BTC as a currency.  [Hal Finney on 30 December 2010]( (he was the first person to receive a transaction from Satoshi): > Actually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases. > Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others. > George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating. > I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the \"high-powered money\" that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.  [hashcoin on 04 July 2011]( described what became known as a payment channel, the fundamental protocol on which the Lightning Network is built: > In general long-term business relationships can agree to just \"settle it in the blockchain later\", but still do it in a way that neither can screw the other. > ... > In this scheme, money is tied up, but still cannot be spent by the other party without authorization from you. On the other hand, you can provide that authorization to them instantly offline of the blockchain. Whether or not you call the whole functioning ecosystem Bitcoin, the fact remains: There must be a settlement layer, and there must be a currency layer built on top of that settlement layer. Weve got the settlement layer working pretty damn well. Now, were working on the layer that will provide cheap, high-volume, instantaneous confirmation for transactions that represent usage of BTC as a currency.\n",

      "Or how about this: you dont know. You dont have the intelligence, or advisors, or even education to begin making such a decision. You cant possibly understand the potential implications that would be involved for our country either way because unlike those who are actually helping make this decision - you have not spent your life studying the thousands of dimensions involved in it. And even if you had there would be a mountain of classified information unavailable to you that might alter your decision. ---------------- Like the blocksize debate, you are free to form a peasants opinion on what we should do, but unless you honestly have the qualifications and training to understand all the ramifications involved (and those who do would be humble enough to still be cautious), you injecting your opinion as gospel only serves to create drama and noise where none should exist. In a republic we are supposed to elect trusted leaders who understand the issues at stake, and are able to make informed decisions for the good of all. I know we may not have elected any of the major players in the Bitcoin universe, but they didnt get there by being dummies. 90% of us have no reason to have an opinion on the blocksize debate because it is a technical specification which ramifications beyond our understanding. We need to trust that core devs and major players in the Bitcoin universe have just as much to lose as we, and will come to a good decision on the matter and communicate it to us in an open fashion. This is my new answer whenever someone asks me what my opinion is on the blocksize debate. \n",

      "A while ago I looked into the Blocksize debate and with the information then available and the arguments pushed by Classic, I felt like I saw the light. I joined /r/btc, installed bitcoin unlimited and later Bitcoin Classic and felt good about it. My reasoning was very simple: 1) My transactions got stuck from time to time and I got annoyed waiting for confirmations. 2) I believed that just increasing the blocksize would solve the issue, everyone can handle 2MB right? 3) I didnt like the fact that a lot of Core devs were all working for the same company (Blockstream) and at that point I believed the goal of Blockstream was to create a LN with paid subscription, which was mentioned a lot of times on /r/btc. Trying to force the average user off the blockchain. 4) I didnt like the moderation on /r/bitcoin. What Ive come to realize in the last week: 1) After reading the arguments by Peter Todd and other core devs in regards of the scaling it makes sense. You cant keep increasing the blocksize, its the wrong approach. Bitcoin by itself will never be able to handle the amount of transactions Visa can. 2) I like the fact that the Core team took the time to have a meeting with the big miners and some other big players in the market to come up with a consensus that neither side is happy with but both can live with. (that shows that its a real consensus and not someone bullying the other one in a bad agreement) 3) If you try to read /r/btc its always the same, excuse my French, circlejerk. Always boiling down to the same issues they have with Core and Blockstream, instead of trying to focus on something positive. After reading [this post]( about one of the main guys behind Classic, I started to have a bad feeling about it. 4) /r/btc tries to take pride in the fact that there is no real censorship, try to make 1 post where you something remotely positive about Core (not even related to the issues with Classic) and youll get downvoted to oblivion, its just another type of censorship. 5) The fact that one of the Blockstream employees, Mark Friedenbach, didnt like the consensus and was open about it, showed to me at least that there is more going on than just Blockstream trying to push their agenda and that they do have, for now, Bitcoins best interest in mind. 6) There is still room to grow if we can fill those empty blocks being mined and Antpool that only fills to 730kb, that should be more than enough until segwit comes out. Other reasons why I switched back: 1) Core has a lot more combined programming experience than Classic, Id rather have a team that has the experience since they will see most potential issues from miles away. Note: Gavin is not an active programmer anymore and so he has nothing to do with Classic code. 2) Some wallets will immediately implement Segwit as soon as its in production and anyone aware of this will use it to get in the next block. I see a lot of people immediately using this which will decrease the mempool. 3) 1 year is long, I admit, but if youve ever been involved in a complicated software project you know that you need enough time to test and prepare all the clients, make everyone upgrade. There will always be nodes that \"forget\" or just dont upgrade. 4) Just increasing the blocksize doesnt work, you need an alternative, LN is the only real realistic solution I see. I dont see 16 MB blocks happening. 5) The Classic community is really small actually, but very vocal and negative. Just check the posts on their page, either extremely negative, trying to find some words they can twist from someone to make it seems they are evil, or the other posts are just that they mined a couple of blocks with a very limited amount of support. 6) The Vocal leaders of Classic Olivier, Brian, Marshall, Roger, either dont have any coding experience, dont understand the impact or they are just not people I want to associate with. TLDR; Id rather be in a positive community and I believe that the roadmap proposed during the roundtable is the way to go forward.\n",

The information above my mind has led me to this question: Given multiple public keys that are known to have the SAME corresponding private key, are the number of possible POTENTIAL corresponding private keys any lower?

Here is the neat part (at least to me). For the password, I came up with a long string of words, some gibberish, as the password for these keys for example: GoodKnackerzCrustiiBut2Tasty Then I have a password hint I keep with the private keys as such: G----dK-----zC----iB---t2T----y I just have to fill in the blanks. The brain seems to do this with ease. Memory can fade so here is another cool thing I do: I set up a weekly reminder to fill in the blanks to refresh the memory neurons. Every week I am filling in the blanks in my head so I dont forget. I also have measures in place in case I croak, but I thought this scheme might be useful to some noobs out there. This system has worked for me for many years. Sometimes I decrypt a key (on an offline machine) just to make sure things are OK too. Also, if anyone sees some holes in my system, please advise... Hope this helps! \n",

      "One issue of Bitcoin today is that the majority of wealth sits with a few people and the bitcoin population is rather low. To become a successful currency Bitcoin needs to be in the hands of many people. A Fix: One of the best uses of Bitcoin is online gambling. Anyone who has used bitcoin gambling on the internet knows how liquid it is. One minute you are at the table gambling and the next you can be spending it however you please. Its like real cash in brick and mortar casinos. A much better experience. One solution to increasing entrants to bitcoin is through online gaming. Online gaming will introduce new users to Bitcoin after wins and allow them to quickly spend it. Many players will originally deposit in their traditional fiat currency and then withdraw their winnings in Bitcoin. Online gaming allows a convenient cheap transition from fiat money into Bitcoin and will significantly grow the population. The Current State: Currently all of the biggest online gambling sites do not offer bitcoin withdrawals or deposits. This included Bovada, William Hill, 888 betting, PokerStars. This leaves a large open market for bitcoin and online gaming. The early gambling sites who have adopted bitcoin have seen it as a major success and I see the day where a site must offer bitcoin to be competitive in the market. And when that day arises, the Bitcoin population will see significant population growth and Bitcoin will be well on its way to being one of the worlds leading currencys. Cliffs: More bitcoin users= More circulation= More mainstream use of a bitcoin. Online gambling is perfect to enter unknowns into the bitcoin community PS. If you do gamble online please email your sites support requesting for bitcoin withdrawals and deposits. \n",
      "They went from shilling Dash, to shilling Classic. Its obvious that they are paying that chick to talk about this stuff in hopes to get the approval of the average joe which is clueless about any of this, the sad part is not even cute chicks shilling your disgrace of a hard fork is working to get any traction going. I used to like this show at the beginning, but quickly I realized it was just a way for people to pay for this girl to talk about stuff. So what do we have right now? Gavin \"CIA-rogue-agent\" Andresen going full Hearn with his latest ramblings, Roger Ver buying Bitcoin.com to turn it into Anti-Core central while complaining about /r/bitcoin/, bro-CEOs like the Xapo guy and Brian Armstrong not caring about Bitcoin as a privacy resistant tool but as a more fashionable Paypal for the dumbfounded future generations so they can control the node datacenters at will, and now this chick getting paid to talk about this day in and day out. I mean this channel is supposed to be informative about crypto, and they dont even talk about 0.12.0 being released, they do not even talk about the great work the Core devs did with this one, they could go into detail and make a great program about all the stuff that this version has. Even newbies would notice the increase in speed when starting up the wallet. I mean we are talking about the very foundation of Bitcoin right here for gods sakes. But theres nothing. The hard fork they are shilling is 99% a copy-paste of Cores amazing efforts and they wouldnt even acknowledge it. I guess thats not very marketable for their target, just as explaining the tradeoffs of their big block agenda. Instead you have some news about how Classic has surpassed XT in number of mined blocks. Can you fucking believe it? Im done with this channel.\n",

      "There is a fundamental problem with Bitcoin: when you lose your coins thats it. They are lost forever. Can we fix that somehow? What if our wallets were a kind of a social network that connects with our families wallets, with our friends wallets, and you ranked them according to trust you have in them. And in case of losing the private key, some magic/consensus happens between our family and friends, and you have your money back. Something like 3/4 of your closest ones have to agree where those coins go, and then it does. Also, if a big transaction is happening, you have to get permission from some of your friends/family (for example, if someone wants to move all your money elsewhere). That could solve hacking your wallet. What do you guys think?\n",

Ideally, Id like to store 75% for the long-term and have immediate access to the other 25%. So, Im looking for some recommendations/clarification on creating a paper wallet (probably?) Or just a general rundown of best options of securing the majority of my coins and having others in a usable wallet. Thanks for any advice/recommendations.\n",
      "SearchTrade makes all its payments in Bitcoin. Since this is a relatively new currency, there are a lot of half-truths and whole lies surrounding it. So let’s just sort through all of it quickly, so that that you can get a better idea of how this currency functions and where it is headed. The money that we use on a day to day basis is controlled by our country’s financial governing body which means that if there is an economic crisis, such as the 2007-2009 recessions in the US, the value of your money will fall drastically. Unlike most currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by any governing body and instead it works on the principle of consensus. Every transaction made within the Bitcoin system is recorded and this record is shared with everyone in the system. If a person tampers with the record, his version will be different from the majority of people in the system and so it will not be accepted. At this point, you might wonder what would happen if a person managed to convince the majority of users to accept an incorrect record. This would be a valid concern if the system consisted of just 10 or 20 people but Bitcoin now has over 4 million users – and is still rapidly growing! It is this independence and decentralization that gives Bitcoin its stability. Bitcoin is a virtual currency which means that it does not exist in the form of notes and coins like the money that we are used to spending on a daily basis.

      "Subscription payments are very important. The lightning network is going to require a fair bit of cash being held in hot wallets. Does bitcoin have to be in a hot wallet for subscription payments to happen? Id imagine so since the transactions need to be signed. Perhaps you could sign future payments, when you subscribe, but youd need to have sufficient funds to cover all those future payments in order to do so (unless I am mistaken). Flattr have (some time ago) stopped accepting Bitcoin, likely because it doesnt support recurring payments. Most services are paid for by subscription. Like I say, lightning network is going to have a similar requirement; funds being available in a hot wallet to be signed programmatically (I should state Im no expert on lightning network, this is my understanding). Stripe want to be able to support subscriptions, but say they cant: BitPay (Ref: and Coinbase (Ref: allow you to setup recurring payments from their custodial wallets. If custodial wallets are already building this functionality into their platforms, I know I for one would certainly prefer it was baked into the bitcoin protocol. One idea I have around this is that you have a \"hot wallet\" of sorts, which youve authorized to send upto a specific amount of funds to specific bitcoin addresses offline. And if you want to change that instruction set, amending those instructions requires some offline action. We could then push for something similar to the direct debit guarantee in the UK whereby if additional funds are sent to a payee they will arrange their safe return without complaint. I understand that in the custodial environment banks provide, ensuring companies do do this is easier. However, it is not that easy to be authorized yourselves as a valid direct debit recipient, and subsequently many businesses choose to process them through a third party such as GoCardless. Perhaps businesses would similarly involve a third party. I think Recurly is a similar offering stateside (that exists for similar reasons?). BIP 70 includes ideas for how bitcoin could handle recurring payments. I havent read it. Ive also seen while reading this that, stateside, theres really nothing stopping people using Paydici (albeit its bitcoin support is built on top of the aforementioned support in Bitpay). Do you know of any wallet developers or others working on bringing this native to bitcoin wallets? Lets not build a future where were reliant on a new set of intermediaries, unless its truly necessary (surely not!).\n",

      "I suppose that this question gets very different answers on /r/btc and /r/bitcoin, but lets give it a try :-) From the \"fee market\"-perspective, the question can be rephrased to \"how much does one need to pay for getting the transaction through\". If this number is growing rapidly, we have a problem. If this number stays reasonably low, then things are cool. I think the best would be to look into historic transaction data and make some statistics on fee/byte vs how much delayed the transaction gets mined. The transactions doesnt contain any timestamp, but i.e. blockchain.info seems to store the received-timestamp for every transaction. I would like to play a bit with this, but Id like to ask for comments first. (there are so many different metrics, important to decide \"what should I do with this data\" before collecting data, its always possible to find data that supports a hypothesis if first deciding which hypothesis is right, and then searching for the right data). The indirect approach would be to use historic estimation data from cointape. Ive thrown up a crontab that fetches the data from cointape every hour, since 2015-11-06. The fees and mempool was growing until mid-December, then there was more than a month of downtime, and when cointape came up again the fee estimates was pretty much lower. I suppose there may have been a bugfix or algorithm change, i.e. throwing away non-mined transactions after 48 hours? After 2016-01-15, the recommended \"fastest fee\" has been mostly jumping between 30 and 60 satoshi / byte, 50 being the median and by far most normal value, some few times Ive observed higher values than that, but never sustained for more than an hour. The average \"fastest fee\" seems to be climbing. (Id like to publish a graph, but may need some help on getting the dates correctly on my pyplot graph, I didnt quite get it right).\n",

      "The recently added opt-in ReplaceByFee feature uses the nSequence number as a flag to indicate if the transaction is subject to RBF or not (or well, intended to be, in the end its still up to individual nodes and miners to apply their own replacement policy). However, in a Bitcoin transaction, each input has its own nSequence. What nSequence is supposed to be interpreted as the RBF flag? The first input? The last? The largest? Or is it sufficient if the nSquence for just any one input (or more, or all) marks the tx the entire tx as RBF?\n",

However there are many transactions with nSequence 4294967294 or 4294967295 (0xFFFFFFFE or 0xFFFFFFFF respectively). Whats the meaning of these two nSequence values? I thought 0xFFFFFFFF (i.e. max uint) used to be the default for regular transactions. Why are there also many txs with 0xFFFFFFFE (i.e. max uint -1) ? When I look at recent transactions, e.g. unconfirmed ones in the mempool, or txs that were confirmed in recent blocks, Id say about 50% has nSequence=0xFFFFFFFE and 50% has nSequence=0xFFFFFFFF. However for older transactions (like 1 year or even further back) practically 100% of all txs have nSequence=0xFFFFFFFF. Whats up with that?

      "First some observations. - There was no transaction backlog on the bitcoin blockchain until two days ago. At 2pm CET February 28th the transaction rate started spiking sharply, and the mempool started building up. - This was immediately followed by a relentless campaign on social media, claiming bitcoin is non functional, broken, doomed. - The transaction fee on the vast majority of these transactions is extremely low, 1-10 satoshis per byte to be exact. If we say 5 satoshi is the average, and knowing the median transaction size is 258 bytes that means 1290 satoshis / 0.5 cents per transaction. - At the moment, with all these transactions sitting in the mempool, you can still be guaranteed to get your transaction confirmed in the next block by paying 60 satoshi per byte, or 15480 satoshi / 6 cents for a median sized transaction. I think we can all agree that getting a transaction confirmed on the blockchain has some value. The hashrate is astronomical, the integrity of the transactional data we get to write on the ledger is beyond anything we have had access to earlier. The moment the mempool is starting to fill up with transactions with fees of 50 cents, hundred times the 0.5 cents of today, I would say we have a legitimate and somewhat urgent problem with the blocksize. I believe we will see scaling solutions implemented long before then. But in the current climate of sudden spikes in transaction numbers with very low fees, I suggest regular users make things really easy for themselves and start paying something like 10 cents per transaction. \n",

      "We all want a censorship-free store of value and a payment system, but it looks likely that on-chain transactions cant deliver both of these ideals together. A payment system that scales properly can be built on top of Bitcoin, be it the form of payment channels such as the Lightning Network, or as a sidechain (federated or not). And youll be able to chose one of a multitude of sidechains depending on your needs (speed/security/locale). Why are people so concerned about lack of on-chain scaling? Are they worried that their Bitcoin investment will suffer? Well, imagine that Bitcoin is the worlds settlement system that all other blockchains are anchored to. Its gold 2.0. Its held as a reserve currency by governments around the world. Its a worldwide ledger that is the backbone to $trillions of global trade. How much would a single bitcoin be worth then? A lot more than it is now thats for sure. And you could still be a part of the network by running a full node, or earning fees on the Lightning Network if it comes to fruition.

      "(JFN Ideal Money) >The label \"Keynesian\" is convenient, but to be safe we should have a defined meaning for this as a party that can be criticized and contrasted with other parties. >So let us define \"Keynesian\" to be descriptive of a \"school of thought\" that originated at the time of the devaluations of the pound and the dollar in the early 30s of the 20th century.

Since the definition above was created before the advent of bitcoin I think it should be updated, since it is quite possible and likely that the Keynesian attitudes that are espoused by so many will pervade the social movement that bitcoin fuels. How did we arrive to support a system that is so detrimental to its own peoples, when the systems that create them are founded on democracy and by the will of the peoples themselves? I think it cannot be but from our own ignorance and our attempts to control and persuade things we do not understand.

I understand that the current problems would not be acceptable in the long run. But while code improvements are still on the roadmap and being developed, why not wait and see how much load the improvements take off the system? In my own experience, having built a global enterprise software solution, I found that scaling should first of all involve exhausting all possible software/coding related improvements, such as caching, intelligent placement of elements, lazy loading, etc., before buying additional servers and space. Intelligent coding can achieve absolutely phenomenal exponential improvements while adding capacity tends to be rather linear. (Not sure how relevant this experience is to bitcoin, Im not a core dev or anything like that).

      "Equivalently: If a transaction is processed into a blockchain, then that transaction is not spam with respect to that blockchain. The [Tragedy of the Commons]( can be curtailed with, say, usage fees that grow until theres proper equilibrium, whereby the resource in question is too expensive to consume unless that consumption is profitably useful. More precisely, if there is a shortage in resource Y, then the market responds by increasing the fee for using Y, which serves 2 purposes:  This is a spam filter that serves to avoid the Tragedy of the Commons. The rising fee establishes a stricter ordering to the demand; it forces the market to recognize that one usage of Y is more important than some other usage of Y, thereby imposing a more efficient allocation of capital throughout the market. Part of the problem is that Bitcoin doesnt yet have good tools for implementing price discovery. Not only is it difficult to determine which fee represents this spam filters threshold, but its currently troublesome to update a fee so that it better represents the intentions of the user. These problems can be at least partially solved by [simplifying limit calculations]( via a hard fork, and by improving policy (i.e., node configuration) via streamlining priority calculations and widely implementing both [Replace-by-Fee]( and [Child-Pays-for-Parent]( Similarly, you could maybe make an argument that older transactions in the mempool should have higher priority, so as to simulate multiple fee-based spam-filter thresholds, but thats entirely reliant on some sense of altruism (kinship reciprocation at the least); its probably better to identify particular use cases around which capacity can be explicitly expanded.  This is a signal that someone should figure out how to increase capacity in some way. The rising fee alerts the market to the fact that there is a growing inefficiency in the system: There is unmet demand, or there has been a loss in productivity. This signals where capital might be worth investing, a choice that is made by comparing all such signals. For instance, perhaps the vast majority of \\[profitable\\] transactions in the Bitcoin system involve the use of BTC as a currency; in that case, it might be wise to construct a solution that increases the capacity [specifically for currency usage](\n",

      "We as nodes make the network secure against miners folly, enforce the rules and help decentralization. When blocks will be raised more pressure will be put on us so that only big businesses will be able to run nodes putting BTC in the hands of big corps and other centralized entities. So I think that nodes should be paid by having lets say 25% (arbitrary number here) of the mining reward, it could be PoS distributed. We keep the PoW for mining/validating and use PoS for funding the full nodes. This change is probably controversial but there is a clear problem about nodes incentivisation in the future as more and more pressure will be put on us ! If you count on altruism to run full nodes sorry to tell you that it will not work in the long term ! So again, want to raise block size ? Fine, then pay us to do it !

      "Just throwing some ideas out there that I know others must have come up with since theyre fairly obvious. Please let me know why these solutions would not work to help the blocksize/spam issue. 1. Compress each transaction prior to entering it in a block. Would this prevent verifying the signature? Is there too much entropy to make this worth the effort? 2. Use a non-stack based language for common transactions. Since most transactions currently are simple Pay-to-PubkeyHash transactions, would it be more space efficient to store them in a more concise way? 3. Remove decimals from the currency. Instead of the smallest unit being 10-8, make it much larger. This will allow users to store the entire UTXO pool with a fixed (but smaller) maximum size. For example, if the smallest unit was 0.1 BTC, then each wallet would be required to store at most 210,000,000 addresses with a corresponding balance. The downside is of course increasing the smallest unit with the benefit of less possible UTXO spam. If this smallest unit was large enough, then in theory couldnt the block limit be removed completely? Perhaps coins must wait a certain number of blocks before they are able to be spent again to prevent coin \"thrashing\". 4. In the end all that a user should care about is that their version of the ledger is the same as the communities. The \"truth\" is relative. If everyone on the network believes that you have 1 BTC but your version of the ledger says you have 2 BTC, then it doesnt matter if you are correct or not - the community will not honor it. The idea is similar to the community blacklisting your coins. Money only has value if others accept it. So keeping that in mind, is it really necessary to store the entire transaction history of the network? After 10,000 blocks, why not just create a checkpoint block and drop the old history. Edit: Im sorry about the noobish nature of the questions. I know that these ideas probably wont work (or else theyd be implemented already). Im not a noob suggesting solutions - Im just a noob asking why the suggestions wont work so that I can better understand bitcoin. Edit 2: Ive clearly offended some of the mods in this subreddit since posts in this thread were deleted, so Ill just downvote this post to hide it.

      "Yesterday I tried out an experiment: I simply asked both /r/bitcoin and /r/btc/ to supply evidence that holding off on a block size increase until we can examine the effect of the current software changes will be disastrous for Bitcoin (vs just a minor nuisance that will go away). See: and After 177 comments I still struggle to find ONE piece of evidence to make that case. Yet, literally all day and night I now see posts on /r/btc/ about how Bitcoin is being destroyed by blockstream, about how person X sold ALL his coins because he \"sees no other way\", about how Ethereum will replace Bitcoin, about how time is running out and we need to ACT NOW to increase the block size, about how this sub is full of propaganda and the poor sheeple on here are being mislead (like its so difficult to just subscribe to another sub), and so on and so on. These posts are reminiscent of old shill accounts I observed in the early days on the forums that obviously had no other purpose than to manipulate the bitcoin price for trading gains, whereas this time I am honestly not sure what their objective is. What a load of BULLSHIT, /r/btc/ has become compromised by a bunch of manipulative shills who are jerking each other off to completely fallacious and baseless arguments, and the lack of concrete evidence for their disaster scenario coupled with constant ad-hominems, slippery slopes, omissions, and their cartoonish portrayal of anyone who disagrees with them all but proves it incontrovertibly.\n",

      "For those of you who dont know, BIP 21 was developped by Nils Schneider and Matt Corallo and originally proposed by Luke-Jr. As I understand it, so far there are four query labels right now, with a fifth for possible extension: - label: Label for that address (e.g. name of receiver) - address: bitcoin address - message: message that describes the transaction to the user (see examples below) - size: amount of base bitcoin units (see below) - (others): optional, for future extensions Motivation: Sharing responsibility between senders and receivers It has been my experience that more often then, it is unexperienced users who usually make miscalculations in fees. In the context of acquiring bitcoins, they are dealing with seasoned professionals (or applications) that in overwhelming cases put the right fee. However, when purchasing digital products or sending bitcoins to other individuals and companies (them being the sender) they are more likely to omit the fee. If technically possible, a potential solution would be for the receiver to encode the minimum required fee it requires through the Bitcoin URI, so that in order to omit the fee the sender would have to manually override the receivers suggested fees. Speaking from experience, this would prevent a lot of awkward situations. Any thoughts? Is this technically feasible? Is it desirable?

Assuming this security model works, and lets assume it does, Bitcoin will add smart contracting abilities equivalent to Ethereums. This, as we know, is a vastly more powerful proposition than simply just currency or payments. Therefore, would it not be rational to expect, that most bitcoins would actually migrate to Rootstock?

The last order I made to China a few weeks ago cost me $88 USD in transfer fees, plus I had to wait 3 days for it to propagate inside their ban account.Before every order I check to make sire the RCs are legal in both USA and where I am ordering from. Im looking for something that will run on Apple (iOS) devices and is relatively easy to use. Something with a nice user interface but most importantly a company that will be around for a while. Of course they would need to be lenient on what I am purchasing (in fact, i cant believe CoinBase even looked into what I purchased) so Im asking here for someone who has first hand, real world experience. One last thing. i plan on launching an e-commerce store in 2 months and will be accepting BTC. So maybe it makes since to pick something that also integrates as a payment gateway, but this is not a priority and should not dictate what recommendations you may have. ~~CoinBase~~ has some serious privacy issues.\n",

      "Hello so i was a user that minnined .5 of a btc years ago back in like 2011/early 2012 on my own desktop with my gpu and since then been fairly out of the loop to whats been going on. i lost my btc due to not being smart with what back then was like $5 and deleted it. yes i feel real bad about that now knowing the value. in 2014 i got into ltc mined it for a few weeks got my self 2 and actually still have control of it and a few hundred dodge. and ended up minning on poolwarz for a while and never got anything out so lost again as i just forgot to take my coins out when i took my miner offline. but did get .01 out and have that in a wallet on blockchain.info using there ios app. and forgot about the whole criptocurrency since. now this week i start reading about this whole core vs classic battle going on and are very confused??? i think theirs xt and unlimited as well?? im also very interested in starting up a node with a raspberry pi 2 that i have extra now that the pi 3 is out. i have seen this 21 thing or Rokos. ?? is there still anyway for someone like me to earn/mine bitcoins thanks for all the help\n",
      "I am one of the biggest proponents of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. I want it to stay as decentralized as possible. With that being said, the devs and the miners need to put aside the petty squabbling and come to some sort of a compromise. Enough is enough. In the end, doesnt everyone want the same thing, for Bitcoin to succeed and become a form of money and a store of value we can all use instead of fiat currency? The fighting is hurting the very idea of Bitcoin becoming what we all want. Please, compromise and work together to make Bitcoin as great as we all know it can be.\n",

      "Hey guys, Needed some input on a new project of mine - Gamebet (www.gamebet.gg). Basically the product allows the gaming demographic to use their Bitcoins to bet on an upcoming E-sports tournament. Currently the following games have been integrated  Hearthstone  Counter Strike  Heart of the Storm  Dota 2  League of Legends. Basically, the crypto element comes where-in gamers can use their Bitcoin / crypto-currencies to bet upon coming matches and withdraw their holdings. This allows anyone, from anywhere in the world to use the network to bet on matches and have their rewards sent back instantaneously. In a large number of cases the matches are accompanied with a live-stream of the match permitting them to see what goes on during the event. There is also a marketplace that permits the users to list their in-game items for Bitcoins. Since a large number of users often do not possess Bitcoin, but rather in-game items from Steams walled economy, this system permits them to either bet with a token we issue (steam silver) or use their Bitcoins to buy other items. This has a number of benefits including  users can now trade their items for other items in a relatively trusted environment  Users that bet with their items can choose what other items they wish to buy with their winnings  Users with Bitcoin now have a wide variety of in-game items they can choose from. I just launched the product in its latest avatar with the marketplace enabled and a new UI. Please do leave me a review / thoughts on what I could better to improvise the project and how I can make it more appealing to users. Thanks a lot for taking the time to read :) Regards\n",

      "Visa takes from 24 hours (for debit) to 6 months (for credit) to settle. Visa supports instant verification, but that money can be \"taken back\" from the merchant at any time during the settlement period. This is called a \"chargeback\". In Bitcoin-speak it would be called a \"double spend\". - Instant verification is suitable for a coffee - Maybe its OK for a dinner... but it depends what part of town youre in. In risky neighborhoods, many restaurants dont take Visa. - Visa cannot be used to buy expensive things like cars, houses and diamonds ----------- Bitcoins settlement increases in security over time. After a 5 seconds, you have more assurance than 1 second. After 10 minutes, you have more assurance . After 40-60 minutes, you have the equivalent of 6 months of Visas \"settlement\". Bitcoin supports instant verification just like visa. Anyone can, at any time check to see if a transaction is valid - instantly. Just like Visa, that money can be \"taken back\" from the merchant at any time during the settlement period. This is roughly equivalent to a \"chargeback\". Currently Bitcoin chargebacks are far less likely than Visa chargebacks. Also, the longer you wait, the less likely a chargeback becomes. - This is suitable for a coffee. Much like a visa transaction. - In about 20 minutes, you have a level of settlement suitable for buying a fancy car. It would cost far more than a car to alter the blockchain after 2 confirmations. You cannot buy expensive things with Visa. - Bitcoin also supports a 20 second \"very high likelihood verification\", where money is \"even harder\" to take back - This is suitable for a dinner - even in a high risk neighborhood! - There are technologies, like green address, that support instant transactions, with a level of surity appropriate for buying a car, and with a level of convenience like Paypal. \n",

      "Bitcoin is supposed to be a peer-to-peer cash system. But we gave it nearly 6 years and found there was no incentive for regular people to use it. We kept looking for Bitcoins killer app, and scratching our heads as to why no mass-adoption was occurring. Lets not forget that. It turned out Fidelity and NASDAQ wanted in. Patrick Byrne of Overstock wanted to build his new stock market system using it. This is when we realized that Bitcoins first real-life application may in fact be for businesses. As a block chain system for very robust companies hoping to save billions, eliminate fraud, and streamline processes. Only one problem: Bitcoins feature-set (and yes, speed) were too limited. But it wasnt just block size. Companies like Fidelity are very feature-rich. They would need a highly flexible block chain system with many forms of extensibility in order to duplicate their many processes onto a block chain. Bitcoin simply couldnt do any of that. Its just peer to peer cash. So NASDAQ bailed from Bitcoin and made their own. Patrick Byrne (Bitcoins biggest proponent) bailed from the direct use of the block chain and went with another system. Fidelity threw up their hands. And many other companies did too. And everyone here mocked them and called them idiots for not using Bitcoin. So what if Bitcoin scales to 2MB? Or even 8MB? What then? Do we really believe this is suddenly going to open the flood gates for usage? Lets not forget where we were before this debate. Sitting around scratching our heads while our family and friends thought we were weird. We were still hoping that the consumer public would find some mass-incentive when there really wasnt one. Raising the block size limit is necessary, now, but this doesnt solve the problem of making Bitcoin feature-rich enough to become a relevant / major player in the block chain revolution. Especially with major corporations which couldve skyrocketed demand and shot Bitcoins value straight to Pluto. I keep coming back to this analogy, and I dont know if its a valid one: if only there was some way to make the bitcoin block chain similar to the iPhone app software. Its just a cell phone. But on the layer above, literally millions of unique, highly customized applications can be built which latch into it. But this requires that the foundational layer has the capability to support such latches. \n",

      "1. Ledger Starter: Very quick. Bare bones. Secure initialization of the ledger device. After trying all the products, I feel this is necessary for the super tinfoil hat people, as restoring devices in the other apps requires typing the phrase into the chrome app. Plus it was pretty cheap. Met all my expectations. 8/10 2. Ledger Unplugged: Used it with Mycelium on Nexus 5, and boy it was cool. The only part I thought was a little awkward was the security card. I remember some smart cards with little screens to check send addresses, and Unplugged made me want those more. The process was a bit too awkward for what I have come to expect from smartphone apps in general. 6/10 3. Ledger HW.1: I got the Copay edition. Its cool that the logo is on there haha. The only real problems I had with this one was figuring out I had to leave the adhesive on the backside and fold it over on to the adhesive... I am a habitual adhesive scraper, so I got half way through scraping it when I realized there was no mechanism to snap it shut except the adhesive. I was confused, lol. Also, I felt like I was going to break it all the time when inserting or removing it. Not sure how long it will last, but it seems to work just as fine as Nano, but for a fraction of the price. Thanks to the price point, Ill give it a 9/10. Went slightly above my expectations. (Except for the build quality of the plastic, that was slightly below) 4. Nano: This feels like the winner. Initialization with the Starter is much more simple (if you squint your eyes at explaining how to boot a USB) than, for instance, Trezor. (Trezor is a 10/10 in my book, dont get me wrong. I own one.) However, normal initialization on the Chrome App is rather insecure. You need to be confident in your computer, which I tend not to be (to be on the safe side) I give the Nano 10/10 with the Starter, 8/10 without the Starter. Overall, one of the biggest gripes I had was the shoddy Japanese translation and the lack of Japanese BIP39 phrase support. If one of the hardware wallets would support a Ledger Starter (or Trezor) -like initialization which is all in Japanese and supports Japanese BIP39, they would get my recommendations to all the investors I meet here in Japan. I thought Starter + Nano was amazingly easy, and would love to recommend... but the English BIP39 phrases always give people pause... breadwallet and Copay have not had that problem when I recommend them, as they both support BIP39 Japanese wordlist. Ive been using Trezor and love it, but I cant really justify recommending it to people here, the price point and difficulty of initialization along with lack of Japanese support including phrases always made me hold back, but Starter + Nano might be my new go to recommend for more serious investors and if it ever became Starter + Nano + full Japanese from start to finish, Id definitely recommend. Ledger, if you need translations / Bitcoiner grade translation checks for Japanese, let me know, Id be happy to help.

      "At 2 cents/kwh which is half of what miners pay (including internet/colo fees), and even if you assume equipment fees are sunk costs, most miners will be out of business in 240 days (0 profit due to difficulty increases and halving). That assumes a 10% average difficult increase, and doesnt factor in the halving. Difficulty calculator: Unless bitcoin switches to POS or POB or something like that, miners will only be located in a few scattered places in the world where electricity is super cheap. And there will be even more consolidation into fewer and fewer pools. Proof of burn works just like proof of work: I do believe, however, that Bitcoin could survive a switching to proof of burn. Its very similar to proof of work (something at stake) and would allow for a rapid decentralization. Upgraded and funded bitcoin full nodes would suddenly become profit centers, and would be the only arbiters of the protocol. Median confirmation times: \n",
      "We havent had a panic sell since the blockchain became backlogged. A lot of people here are not investors or traders IRL and may not understand what could happen if theres a flash crash or panic sell. A panic sell of Bitcoin right now could be like a rush to the exits in a building with too few exits. Bitcoin held onchain in cold or hot wallets will be stuck as the market dives. But Bitcoin held off chain on exchanges will trade normally. So there can be a significant divergence of price between liquid Bitcoin on exchange and illiquid Bitcoin onchain. This is indicative of a fungibility problem. We can see from this example/ warning the danger of being unable to absorb peak onchain transactions without creating a long backlog.\n",

      "Sorry im neither a programmer nor digital currency expert, but seems to me a simple solution to solve the scalability problem. The wifi routers are the first stage between the customer and internet, so we must think on it as a cash-register. In the future the wifi routers have to be equipped an additional function could be managed through the wifi-web interface. Each of the customers need to maintain a \"consumer balance\" at the local scene of their consuption. Each of this personal balance is a bitcoin wallet address, created and operated by automatically the wifi router (of the store owner). The future specification must allow to the user to transfer bitocoin between its own personal blockchain wallet, and the customer wallet vica versa. (if he/she want revoke the not-consumed part from the customer account, the wifi-router software must collaborate so he/she must feel the ownership of his/her customer wallet) If, the customer has one (or more) customer balance at the local service providers (store, coffeshop) there is not neccessaty to send each transaction to the main blockchain, the transaciton state can be kept in the local wifi router EEPROM. The next step to improve the protocol, is the consumer balance propagation. For example: it would be nice, if the consumer created a balance at Bellas coffe shop, and would like to use it at the local hardware and machinery store also. So, need to create local wifi pools and share the customer balances. Each pool-member has all of the userdata of the other pool members, and need a p2p propagation mechanism to update. For storage capacity reason, the number of the pool members should keep under 1024 unit. The next step of the protocol development is to ensure the communication between the pools. If the customer travelling to Africa, he would like to use his home customer account, so the local african pool must be reach the other pools (broadcasting?) This is a very simple approaching, i hope it is useful to the experts. \n",

      "The people who think they should use Bitcoin to buy a latte are the same people that live off of student loans for years as they “work” on a useless degree. These are ignorant people who do what is most satisfying in the moment without any idea about how things really work or the value of money. Bitcoin is revolutionary to the extent that it provides an apolitical means of storing and exchanging value. Money is more political now than ever, and when someone tells you what you can and can’t do with your money, they own you. Ignorant people end up getting owned by those who control their money, whether through debt payment on a student loan or by a government which denies them access to their money via inflation, taxation, theft or capital controls. Obviously the Bitcoin blockchain (BBC) will not scale to satisfy every trivial transaction. I’ve seen the estimates, some of them written by Hearn a long time ago indicating how the BBC can scale to PayPal loads or Visa loads. So what? Don’t you think that we are headed down a path where transaction load is going to explode exponentially? Of course it is, as soon as the pipelines are working. The BBC is the all-important settlement layer. Ask yourself – why don’t we already have this exponential explosion of micro transactions? It’s not because we don’t have the technology. For instance, Google aggregates page views and clicks and mediates the exchange of value. Facebook monetizes people’s inner lives. This is extremely complicated and cumbersome. You probably think that Facebook and Google use these techniques because people like “free” stuff, like student loans! That is true, but there is another reason. The interactions with the users of Google and Facebook are not taxable, even though they are micro transactions of a sort. The aggregation of value and the payment of taxes are subsumed into the vast operations of Google and Facebook. Of course there is financial accounting, and money flows between Google and Facebook and the client corporations which use their services to gain access to the public, but the micro transactions remain unmolested. With the BBC we see the potential for a grand orchestration where you no longer need a Google or Facebook, with their lobbyists and tax lawyers, because the top level mediation of value is handled without permission. In order to realize this vision we need to work our way down to the micro transaction level with recursive layers of similar block chains. Once we have one level of side chain we will be able to go deeper and deeper using the same techniques recursively. For the non-programmers out there think about the movie Inception. At the end of this we have more or less infinitely scalable transaction capability which is permissionless, i.e. uncorrupted at every level. And the demand will be more or less infinite as the value of this network feedback loop kicks in. The key to making this work is fungibility. That’s the real problem with the BBC, not block size or the block reward halving. But that is a topic for another day. \n",
      "Isnt that like saying we dont need to curb our emissions today in order to fight climate change because eventually there will be an alternative to fossil fuels and it will be a non-issue? I recall that the 2mb increase was a compromise (down from the 8mb increase that was in consideration some time back). Why is the 2mb increase not an acceptable compromise while efforts are underway to develop the lightning network and segwit? I feel that even people who love lightning and segwit should be at least open to considering the 2mb increase since it doesnt seem like too radical of a change and the purpose of the increase is not to set a precedent since conditions and advances in the network will be different months from now than they are now. I think arguing for an increase when the lightning network actually exists and segwit is live will probably be a non-starter since hopefully in the future there will be absolutely no need for an increase. Im not trying to be divisive or a troll and this is nothing against lightning network or segwit of course as Im really looking forward to those solutions. Im really curious why different sides cant reach a compromise that recognizes the promise of lightning network and segwit while also catering to current concerns in the community. I am just wondering about this because the two advances (LN, segwit) dont exist yet but it seems like we are planning and acting as if they already exist.\n",
      "In 2015, bitcoin has got the attention of huge financial giants like American Express and Visa which has really improved its reputation in the market. The main reason behind the acceptance of bitcoin by financial industry is the blockchain system which facilitates low-cost trading. Resultant is the huge investments and interest of big shots like Schroders and Aberdeen Asset Management in bitcoin. On the whole, there is a ray of hope for this digital currency to enter into the mainstream business soon. However, there are still many who are ignorant about Bitcoin invention or find it hard to accept it as a new currency. Under such circumstances, what would make the leading e-commerce business owners to accept bitcoins? With the increasing interest of corporate world into the Bitcoin, there are speculations that US government might accept it as the currency. And if that happens, e-commerce entrepreneurs would be in loss if they don’t recognize bitcoin. Last year, many bitcoin related start-ups have popped up which further pushes e-commerce businesses to relate with the world of bitcoin. But how people who run e-commerce portals are going to benefit is the question that lurks in many minds? To start with the list of benefits that e-commerce business owners can expect from virtual money, foremost thing to consider is bitcoin would attract an entirely new and huge customer base. There are many consumers who are eager to use their bitcoins and e-commerce portals have the maximum potential to quench their desire. Secondly, bitcoin is a strong factor that can make any e-commerce portal to stand apart, leaving behind the competition. Thirdly, e-commerce portals can get a big relief from the extra costs associated with credit card transactions. As bitcoins have relatively low transaction fees, e-commerce business owners have the chance of saving more. Not to forget the important and last advantage of bitcoin over conventional currencies is it can be transferred to anywhere in the world within ten minutes. The promptness of bitcoin holds a great value in this digital era where everything we need with the speed of light. With some basic and essential security certifications like SSL encryption, e-commerce businesses can certainly amplify their growth with many folds. However, it would take time for this native currency to completely overtake the prevalent national currencies. As for now, offering bitcoin as the alternative mode of payment would be a great way to be a part of this digital world.\n",

My intention is to spread another idea to study and to implement to change this world, again. So some will feel, I am here with another gift to the world. We can end poverty. First some history.

Actually, it should not matter if You are a brilliant lawyer, business man or simply an artist or musician. However, they did put a system in place, lets say money. See this in math like your metric. I do remember my professor in math who did learn us, You can mess with a lot but do not alter Your metrics during your measurements or You are busted. We can make the same thought about money. How can money be a metric if banks and governments do commit a ponzi, fraud to print money behind Your back. So thats the reason I did invent in the first place, bitcoin. So there would be no mess anymore with such things. Some do known, I made some statements in the genesis block in this regard, based on an article on the financial situation of the banks. NO DOUBT, we have only a few months or years left and WE have a total collapse of the financial market. You will see. So be prepared. Do not cry Your money will be vanished or not reachable on the banks. They will close their doors and do their game, as they did, decades ago. For those who do not trust bitcoin, litecoin, whatever. Take my humble advise, invest in gold or silver. REAL Gold/Silver, not paper. As do not store it at the banks. Put it in impossible places and shut Your mouth. Needless to say, now You are all educated, thanks to the movie on Youtube (thanks Guys), Money as Debt, fractional banking is actually a fraud system, many banks, rich families, elites and the governments did abuse it. The common people does use the paper money because they dont have any other option, but it has a short life to go. But things are what they are, WE have to look TO CURE the system. Temporary money will still be needed. Temporary. I do expect this will change in a couple decades from now. Some do say, we go back to the gold standard. Like my good friend Mr Putin, sharing the same name as my Dutch friend, Wladimir. But I think, in future, once we travel in space, we can have major problems, if we do find a huge pile of gold. Or maybe we find a mountain full of gold. Or maybe we can collide atoms to gold, whatever. So I rather do belief in a system we all known, such as our blockchain technologies. Beware US of the Quantum computer, but until this is fully operational, we are quite safe in cryptology. Anyway, now I come forward with another revolutionary idea. We should Ditch poverty. If WE want to advance as human species, in a dangerous, technological world, where ONE PERSON, can destroy a lot of lives, goods from other people, WE better make everyone, happy to live in ... comfort. Face it. Bad things do happen because people are poor, wounded, hurt or not well educated. Most of the time. So I ask all the core developers to study my idea - I have no time to write another paper. As I told, I can not sign that one with my keys, and currently I am busy to look/fix for them as crazy Here we go. 1. We should need to find a way to create unique assigned, personalized wallets in such way, we can link without dispute ONE WALLET to ONE INDIVIDUAL. How, we have to find out. 2. This wallet should be protected by many ways so the individual can always claim his wallet. How, we have to find out. 3. Each transaction of bitcoin, should be deducted with a micro-amount. This fee should be automatically send to a second blockchain. So a transaction would be two parts. one part, the transaction of the money, second part, the transaction of the fee. The TOTAL of those two is a VALID transaction in case of hick-up. 4. We focus on the fee. The fee should be a micro-amount. It arrives in the second blockchain. From there on, that amount should be re-distributed in PICO-amounts (or smaller) to the unique assigned, personalized wallets. So what does this mean. Person A is rich, has a big wallet, spends 1000 BTC a day in transaction. Person B is poor, small wallet, spends only 0.1 BTC a day in transaction Person C lives in Afrika, has nothing at all but his/her unique assigned, personalized wallet. So person A contributes a lot to the second blockchain, person B a little bit, so when person C does wake up in the morning, that person does see a small increase of bitcoin in his or her wallet. In this way, we can make and use the blockchain as a way to provide everyone on the planet, an unconditional basic income to survive. This will make a social revolution.

Here quoting from an article I just read: \"Armstrong then pushed for the creation of a \"new team\" to guide development of bitcoin. He wrote that the preferred team would be one that is \"welcoming of new developers to the community, willing to make reasonable trade offs, and a team that will help the protocol continue to scale\". He suggested that Coinbase would play a role in the creation of this new group. \"In the future, we will need to create a new team to work on the bitcoin protocol and help bitcoin become a multi-party system to avoid the systemic risk of core being the only team working on the protocol,\" he wrote, adding: \"I hope to have an update for you on that in the coming months.” \" \n",

      "Netki and breadwallet have been working on an extension to BIP70 which would allow developers and UX designers to move away from traditional Bitcoin addresses and let users specify a recipient using something similar to an e-mail address--without compromising privacy or security, which is the biggest problem with the static Bitcoin addresses of today. The idea is pretty simple: if we could expand the payment request standard to support encryption, wallets could share payment addresses through a third party intermediary without risking a man-in-the-middle attack or divulging any private information. Servers (like e-mail servers, tied to a domain using DNS) would route these messages between devices, allowing wallets to request and receive a unique payment address for every transaction. All the requester would need is the payees human-friendly identifier (something like an e-mail address). We wanted the protocol to be as flexible as possible, so we designed it with additional use cases in mind. Maybe someone wants to work on a distributed address book service, so we dont even need servers? Maybe someone could tie the service to Facebook or Twitter, so sending a Bitcoin payment is as easy as choosing the handle of the recipient? Accepting this BIP would open the door to many creative solutions down the road and make Bitcoin much more user-friendly. The proposal has already been submitted to the mailing list, and an easy-to-understand blog post can be found here: The actual BIP can be seen in full here: We look forward to any thoughts or feedback from the community!\n",

      "For those who do not remember there was a spam attack back in July 15 and the mempool got clogged with over 200,000+ transactions. Around the same time LTC had meteoric rise from 2 to 8.65. On July 8th this was the top post on /r/bitcoin: The next day, LTC hit the high of 8.65 and within a week the price dumped to 3. There is no direct evidence that this attack was orchestrated to pump and dump litecoin, however, it did show a possible vulnerability to attack Bitcoins user base. This attack is a direct reward response for spamming the blockchain as it can frustrate Bitcoin users to make them move to altcoins. The rising of the value of the altcoins gives fuel to spammers to sustain the attack. If I was coordinating the attack I would do it something like this:  Accumulate a large position in an altcoin over time without trying to move price too much.  Start the spam attack and acquire more of the altcoin pumping the price so that it might garner some attention  Create negative propaganda against bitcoin about transactions, devs, the technology etc.  Sell enough of the pumped altcoin to sustain the attack if funds were low  Make one final spam push to really frustrate users then dump the altcoin after it bubbles. Unlike July, Bitcoin is much more vulnerable to this type of attack. The user base is much more frustrated, fearful, and anxious as we near the block size limit. The attack is much cheaper sustain also now that blocks are closer to being full. I am not saying this the case with the certain altcoin that has seen very large gains recently, but it could be a possibility. I do fear these types of attacks will get easier as blocks get more full. If I was the attacker I would try to cause a fee event in Bitcoin where tx fees were pushed to bubble like levels. This could possibly be done nudging the lower limit of transaction fees that are guaranteed to be in a block higher and higher until it snowballs and causes a panic. If this occurred frustration levels would skyrocket, users would be envious of the altcoins rise, and a large portion of Bitcoins user base would be captured and dumped on. Unfortunately, I do not see a way to prevent this attack other than making the community aware of it and just remember to stick to your convictions and HODL.\n",

      "I dont fall on either side of the block size hard fork debate really. But Im just curious about what most people think about this. I personally think the security of a Bitcoin TX could garner a significant fee while still being cost effective. However, as many have noted, this just isnt the case for cash payments. But there is an entire industry of payments, transfers, contracts, and so on that would wet themselves at the prospect of a transaction with even a 50 cent or $1 fee, confidentiality, 30 minutes to irreversibility, and without needing a third party. This does suggest that a normal Bitcoin transaction wont be used for normal cash payments online, but this is inevitable is it not? Bitcoin Literally does not have a ghost of a chance at scaling to be an international payment system of on-chain daily purchases. Its just never going to happen as a decentralized network. It has to be built in layers or spread out among many crypto currencies. Again, not trying to start an argument. I just want to get full perspective from those who vehemently disagree with the current roadmap. Do you think on-chain Bitcoin can be a long term payment option? Where do you see it in 5 years for Bitcoin usage as online cash? Wasnt this always just a transistional use?\n",

      "Hey guys, A very strange error occurred to me when trying to disable the blockchain.info second pass and also when spending btc of the wallet (second pass required). It happened just after I created a new Blockchian.info account on my laptop, verified the email and cell phone (sms) and enabled the google authenticator. Then I clicked devices and pair device to make the wallet pair with the Blockchain.info mobile wallet. Downloaded the app from Play Store and clicked open my wallet. Then an update your wallet message came through and I canceled it, another please enter your double encryption pass message and I canceled it. A bar-code scanner was needed and I installed it. The pairing QR code appeared and I scanned it, the funds (equal to the ones in the laptop device wallet) came through. So, I tried to spend some bitcoins, the second password was required, I typed it exactly as I created it and the message \"Double encryption error, please try again\" comes out. I tried this for seven or eight times in the same day. In the following day I did it all again with a new Blockchain.info account and new Blockchain.info mobile app with tiny amount of btc (just for test) and all went well. Now I can log in my account with the main password but cant spend the btcs. Its sounding like something got corrupted (second pass??) at the time I paired the mobile wallet to the laptop wallet.

      "On forbes, on the verge and buisness insider even here on reddit and various other places on the web a story has been emerging that bitcoin is collapsing because its nearing capacity. The mainstream media has tried since the beginning to take out bitcoin by among other things associating bitcoins with organised crime and even terrorism. Im not saying its a problem, but this time it seems like a portion of the community is actually in on it. There is nothing else to say, than bitcoin has been \"running at full capacity\" for weeks now. Yet the network is not collapsing, however some people are learning the hard way. They get transactions stuck because they dont know they have to pay attention to transaction fees. 21 Inc. did the right thing by making a site which helps determine what fee is appropriate. But the problem is some wallets use a different metric. In due time a standard for how to measure and determine fees will emerge and it seems like the x amount per kb per satoshi is winning out. Wallets, exchanges etc. will need to adapt, and as they do we will be hearing less of delayed and stuck transactions, and we will show once again the mainstream media were wrong about bitcoin.

Because running a full node has a cost, a huge cost actually. This is what concerns the code devs and they are right.\n",

It would be interesting to see the statistics of, say, ~30 minute average change in Bitcoins market cap, following one of these tweets. Is it statistically significant? I cant imagine the then translation of those tweets, and Medium posts, to Chinese doesnt incite further panic and selling half way across the globe. It certainly hurts Bitcoins perception. Maybe a billion in market cap (investor equity) up in smoke? Long ago... Naval commented in this talk about Bitcoins resistance to centralization pressures and commercialization (at least, to some degree). I suspect an interesting foreshadowing of some of the power struggle we see now (as the cypherpunks attempt to retain control from commercial interests): Its interesting now to see this dynamic play out, as investors (Bitcoin holders) and business (Coinbase, etc.) pull Bitcoin in different directions. Of course, ultimately investors get the say, since they support the market capitalization which ultimately drives incentives across the entire ecosystem.\n",

      "I think the community should know that as a group, at the Satoshi Roundtable, a majority of participants sat down together and attempted to identify points that to modify the [Hong Kong Agreement]( in a way that might satisfy its opposing parties. The participants to this exercise included both proponents of both Classic and Core. The intent was not to have some sort of \"backroom deal\" or binding agreement whatsoever, but identify some items additional to the Hong Kong agreement that could help bring the opposing camps together. I regard it as an exercise whose positive outcome was at minimum to identify the specific points of contention (identifying these is the key to moving forward together as a community). Personal comment: I had not felt such a wave of optimism in regards the scaling debate in a long time. The imperative was to agree on a process that satisfies the following requirements: - Increase the throughput of the Bitcoin network by 2x-3x yearly for the next two years. - Reach some consensus and achieve some form of unity/truce before the halving. The four items proposed were: - Clarify the language concerning the hard fork parameters. \"Around 2MB and no more than 3MB\" would be replaced by simply \"2MB\", as proposed by the Bitcoin Classic implementation. - Implement a \"readiness signaling mechanism\". Essentially, wallets would \"signal\" their capacity/readiness to handle a fork. This lays the foundation for a system in which users are able to voice their opinion on certain key issues. Its not voting, just a method to poll the wallets. - Modify the miner threshold from 75%, as proposed by classic, to 95%, as proposed by Core. - Move up the estimated activation date. Having readiness signaling showing a vast majority of wallets ready to upgrade would stomp out some of the risks associated to a quick hard fork. A specific date was not mentioned, but it is my understanding (and this is my personal impression, not by any means something factual) that we were talking about cutting 6 months. If any participants to the exercise feel Ive misrepresented the points, please tell me. I did not write this down, its form memory. After having drafted these points, the group asked a Bitcoin Classic developer for his opinion. He stated that there was no consensus, but did not elaborate. After lunch, the CEOs of two prominent Bitcoin companies were invited to comment on this proposal and argued against it on the grounds that this was still \"too vague\" and that, regardless, the issue had more to do with the identity of the developers than the scaling process. Ill just say that according to an informal \"show of hands\", most of the Core roadmap / existing Hong Kong agreement proponents present at the meeting were in favor. Many of the people you would refer to as \"thought leaders\" of Bitcoin Core were in favor and contributing actively to the exercise. Im curious to see if you personally had been present at the meeting, would you have approved these additions/modifications? Do you think they are necessary? Do you think more compromise should have been made? What additional points would you have suggested? \n",

Before I uninstalled Electrum, I had 1 mBTC left, which is now viewable in my transaction history. However, it seems to have gone now, as my balance says that I have 0 bitcoins. What do I do?

I choosed Linux as Operative System for bitcoind and bitcoin qt and well, the thing is that I found up to 8 virus on this location: /home/user/.bitcoin/chainstate/ like for instance: /home/user/.bitcoin/chainstate/427915.ldb: Gen 981 FOUND well, CLAMAV reports 8 viruses on these .ldb files contained on /home/user/.bitcoin/chainstate/ GEN 981, Violetta-B, Gergana-222, Gen 100 Years 1, Phantom, Italian 1, Copyright.2, Syslock.2 are the names Tried to find out if some other users where afected or how this could be solved, the only thing I found is a similar problem related with sst files on Windows users and some other reports but no forum discussion. Would like to ask someone who would know about it what should I do next?. of course I can erase them with sudo clamscan -r --remove/home but ... will I mess something on bitcoind, bitcoin-qt ? What could I do?. I don´t feel like safe using this due to CLAMAV, but little do I understand about virus or malware, apart from scanning. So I m making this post to let the community know about it and in hope I could find a solution and/or explanation. Kind Regards.\n",
      "Hi there, I would like to share with you some new product of mine, It’s a Bitcoin ranking engine, You can think about it as a \"Credit Scoring\" for the Blockchain. You probably familiar with Standard & Poors or Moodys, But as we know, there is no \"Credit\" in Bitcoin, so what we are ranking here is the transactions behavior of the Bitcoin \"entity\" , it could be an individual person or a Bitcoin company, but all of their transactions are recorded on the Blockchain, we just need to be wise enough to understand how to summarize this information into something useful. Its very ambitious, but with a lot of research we can do it possible. Take a look here : Riders is an analytical tool for the Blockchain , The main objectives of this product are : 1. Recommend whether you should or should not make business with that Bitcoin entity . (Based on his Blockchain history...) 2. To Identify the address owner. (We need to understand if the address is a part of \"Tree\" or its just and individual that plays Satoshi Dice…) 3. And of course, ease of use, everyone should use it, its not an analytical platform , all the hard stuff should stay in the back… I would love to here what you think, or some questions about how it works if you have!

      "For the last few months everything around bitcoin has been about gaining consensus on the Block size matter. As an interested party (early adopter), I have been closely following the conversations on a daily basis with the hope that the different groups of developer might reach consensus. Looking back I now know that I have been naive, let me explain why. We should not try to reach, or for that matter expect that any consensus on a subject like the block size can be reached, if the debating parties have no alignment on what they want bitcoin to be. What is bitcoin? What do we want it to be? Is decentralization more important than efficency and ability to resolve customers problems? What is more important for bitcoin now? Before we hope to reach consensus, we need to be able to get alignment on these answers, trying to do it before is ingenuous, if you allow me an analogy, it would be like asking Al Quaeda and the LGBT to get consensus on womens rights. They do no have alignment on what they think the world should be, so consensus is not reachable. Are bitcoin developers, miners and other influential entities going to answer the questions above? Are they going to be honest? Can we try to get an alignment on the future of bitcoin, transcendent of block size, that takes into consideration customers needs?

      "Bitcoin Bank Coinbase is the most pro-government, pro-regulation, pro-status-quo company in Bitcoin space. They bend over backwards to over-comply with any and all AML/KYC/ABC regulations the bureaucrats of the world invent. As a consequence, they treat their \"customers\" like criminals on parole and keep their bitcoins hostage to the fullest extent. I shudder to think of the moment Coinbase is able to enforce their \"vision\" on Bitcoin ecosystem at large. God forbid Brian Armstrong becomes our Master of the Protocol! We are truly and deeply fcked if this comes to pass. There was always a threat of Bitcoin being subsumed and dominated by a crypto-version of trusted financial middlemen. Such middlemen will necessarily strip any notion of confidentiality and censorship-resistance if they come to control and \"guide\" the protocol development. Brians recent remarks on medium seem to indicate that this is exactly his intentions at this point. It would not be such a concern if Brian Armstrong were just another egomaniacal nobody aspiring to become King of Bitcoin. But unfortunately its not the case - Coinbase currently has huge influence and power. Not only is it the most popular online wallet and significant exchange. Ive seen estimates that currently more than 10% of all BTC in existence reside in addresses under Coinbases direct control. This gives them enormous leverage. Potentially, they could engage in all kinds of fractional reserve tricks, with their customers none the wiser. Like using borrowed coins to crash the price on their exchange at a convenient moment, dragging the whole Bitcoin market down via arbitrage (doesnt it look like this is exactly what happened with the markets TODAY?) In order to prevent Coinbase from taking over the ecosystem and dictating us their will, the community needs to take a decentralized action. We need to weaken Coinbases power. How? Quite simple - defund it. Dont keep any of your coins in Coinbase wallet (owners of those 10% existing BTC! hello!) Even better to close your account altogether, thus sending Brian Armstrong a message. Dont use their exchange if you can help it (there are many decent alternatives: Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini, etc). If you are using their exchange, remove purchased coins from your Coinbase wallet immediately. Dont fall for Buy with Coinbase trick that some of the merchants try to pull on you. Demand that your merchant accept direct bitcoin payments, not bitcoin bank debit. Dont recommend Coinbase to anyone and actively discourage people from using it in favor of the alternatives. Hell, even if somebody wants to purchase BTC directly from their bank account, Circle is not that bad. At least their CEO is NOT on a self-assigned mission to take over Bitcoin. In order to pro-actively prevent this takeover, we have to act - and the time for your action is NOW!\n",

      "Im just a newbie, but it seems to me that a lot of people are under the assumption that Bitcoin is equivalent to a currency, but boundless and digital. Its not. Bitcoin, from the inherent natural inability or lack of planning to scale Im reading about in the news, seems to be an experiment to find out whether a series of numbers could be given value in the real world by people expending their own assets to mine it. It doesnt look like it was built to handle a million transactions every minute for a $2 burger or $10 tank fill up. Its inability to act like a transaction network makes me believe that it perhaps was not built to be one, nor a currency. An asset perhaps, but not money. So being a newbie, I want to know exactly what the Core people and Classic leaders are trying to do. It sounds like Core wants to keep it as a science experiment and Classic wants to fully turn it into a currency/transaction network. Who is trying to achieve what here ?\n",

      "Ive read lots of arguments about the need for more full nodes, but Im having trouble understanding just why the full nodes have any leverage on miners. Suppose the miners decide not to halve the block reward on schedule this year. What would happen? Even if 90% of nodes reject these blocks, maybe the miners could work out a deal with an exchange to sell the newly minted coins. But maybe not, as it might be hard for the exchange to find enough people buying Bitcoin with an ongoing crisis. And in the network of full nodes that is following the original rules, the hashing power is decimated--and security with it. It seems bad for both groups. In my understanding, the main motivation for miners to obey the rules of the community is that their longterm wealth is tied to Bitcoins long term success.

In order to prevent Coinbase from taking over the ecosystem and dictating us their will, the community needs to take a decentralized action. We need to weaken Coinbases power. How? Quite simple - defund it. Dont keep any of your coins in Coinbase wallet (owners of those 10% existing BTC! hello!) Even better to close your account altogether, thus sending Brian Armstrong a message. Dont use their exchange if you can help it (there are many decent alternatives: Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini, etc). If you are using their exchange, remove purchased coins from your Coinbase wallet immediately. Dont fall for Buy with Coinbase trick that some of the merchants try to pull on you. Demand that your merchant accept direct bitcoin payments, not bitcoin bank debit. Dont recommend Coinbase to anyone and actively discourage people from using it in favor of the alternatives. Hell, even if somebody wants to purchase BTC directly from their bank account, Circle is not that bad. At least their CEO is NOT on a self-assigned mission to take over Bitcoin. In order to pro-actively prevent this takeover, we have to act - and the time for your action is NOW!\n",
      "Hi Mike, Im glad to answer any questions you have. If I get time, I ought to write a FAQ to supplement the paper. There is only one global chain. The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide. Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost. It never really hits a scale ceiling. If youre interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size. By Moores Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10. Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions. I dont anticipate that fees will be needed anytime soon, but if it becomes too burdensome to run a node, it is possible to run a node that only processes transactions that include a transaction fee. The owner of the node would decide the minimum fee theyll accept. Right now, such a node would get nothing, because nobody includes a fee, but if enough nodes did that, then users would get faster acceptance if they include a fee, or slower if they dont. The fee the market would settle on should be minimal. If a node requires a higher fee, that node would be passing up all transactions with lower fees. It could do more volume and probably make more money by processing as many paying transactions as it can. The transition is not controlled by some human in charge of the system though, just individuals reacting on their own to market forces. Eventually, most nodes may be run by specialists with multiple GPU cards. For now, its nice that anyone with a PC can play without worrying about what video card they have, and hopefully itll stay that way for a while. More computers are shipping with fairly decent GPUs these days, so maybe later well transition to that. ~ Satoshi Nakamoto, email to Mike Hearn\n",

      "Forgive me. I am guilty of first learning to understand “political motivation” and also essentially deceptive tactics. Although it is a subjective view to whoever espouses it, there is the possibility that balance in this regard is valuable. To see both sides in the face of an overwhelming opinion to only one that is mass adopted. I came to bitcoin differently, and I realize completely now that I will always have an inability to explain the flash of insight I had when I realized what bitcoin could be for our civilization. I think some people have understood me from the beginning, and I truly expect many to more to follow as time goes by. This change is happening now I believe, as many of us TRULY begin to understand the dangers, implications, and importance of the block-size debate. I think we are ready to understand something. I see my posts are gathering steam from confident and well-learned followers of the bitcoin movement. I dont wish to manipulate the voting process, but if you see this to be an intelligible post, I wish you to help levate the content, to those that might not yet fully understand what I mean to say and the incredible significance of the content. Admittedly, I also must compress what I say, but rest assured, I have done my homework (citations and quotes on my blog), and I dare say I am the most knowledgeable person in the world right now on the subject of Ideal Money and its relation to bitcoin (even Satoshi wont confront me publicly on this!). Many people want to point out Ideal Money is not about bitcoin-they have missed the most significant point of their lifetimes. WHAT... does the lecture Ideal Money mean, in relation to bitcoin? Have we explored this? I want to explore it together. In order to do so. In order to give Nashs works the attention and awareness it so deserves, we have to at least make room for the possibility that there are SUPER-ORDINARY peoples in this world. Here is Hal Finney re: Nash: John Nash, proto-Extropian? John Nash, proto-Extropian: We have to make room for the possibility that the narration Nash gives about how Ideal Money will come about IS relevant TODAY. And to be clear and honest, Nash is WELL known for this level of super-natural insight. He thought on a higher order this is clear. I believe (this could be a mis-quote) that Nick Szabo suggested bitcoin will hit its true relevance in about thirty years (perhaps its been 7 already). Forgive me, but I dont agree. He cannot have planned for the psychology of the people, which is exactly related to the phenomenon of Ideal Money. This discussion is going to change, if not specifically because I will it to. We need to discuss, in bohmian dialogue, the validity and value of bitcoin as a settlement mechanism. And as we do so, the subject of what Ideal Money is will earn its proper place in the discussion. Put in Bohmian language: it must be “re-levated”. The paper and lecture Ideal Money is the most significant works in the history of man. But it must be held up to the proper light in order to see this. It is an epilogue that will stand the test of time for many thousands of years I have no doubt. Ideal Money is an enthymeme for bitcoin. It is the cradle in which bitcoin as a settlement layer perfectly sits. Do we understand the significance of all this? It reads very clearly for the general public it was written to, but you must also bring a clear mind, free from prejudice to see this. I dont know how he did it, but it doesnt matter. Nash already had this argument with HIMSELF, the master of game theory, in various lectures and papers over a span of 20 years. Perhaps completely unbeknownst to Satoshi and the whole gang. It doesnt matter. Briefly put, Ideal Money is an asymptotic process that begins with the introduction of an international currency of comparable stable QUALITY. Beyond this the gravitation it brings especially in relation to the psychology of the people, we expect our money systems to naturally evolve to a money that is COMPARABLE to money that is stable in relation to a CONCEPTUAL ICPI. I urge us to open the conversation, levate the subject of Ideal Money, and then turn towards Bohmian Dialogue, NOT “discussion” or “debate”, on the relevance of bitcoin to Nashs works. But this takes incredible sincerity and open-mindedness. It takes co-ordination from those that know and are sincere. Once we can approach this subject as a group then we will begin to understand how this man has furthermore revolutionized our understanding of Einsteins works on relativity (I have just as much to present on this as well): But with all the infighting, with all of the ignorance towards higher level order, I cannot by myself make these things relevant. They need special consideration and “re-levance”. It took over 40 years for us to recognize when Nash revolutionized our economy and all sciences with his discoveries in his 20s. Let us not wait so long this time, its already been 20. Hold Nashs words up to the light, let us hold dialogue on what is re-levant: >...this parallel makes it seem not implausible that a process of political evolution might lead to the expectation on the part of citizens in the “great democracies” that they should be better situated to be able to understand whatever ill bet he monetary policies which, indeed, are typically of great importance to citizens who may have alternative options for where to place their “savings”.~John Forbes Nash, Ideal Money\n",
      "Heres a coffee purchase example using hypothetical Lightning Wallets: Imagine you are actually an adult and have a budget, so you give yourself $60 a month for coffee. You simply open your trusty LN wallet, pick a coffee hub (its connected to popular coffee places) and this allows you to pre-purchase your budgeted amount for coffee, by locking it into the channel. Checkout is easy, as you simply scan a qrcode at the register, your wallet signs it, and sends them a micropayment. Done! If we accept this concept of LN hubs, then we should think about what sorts of things will likely be grouped for efficiency sake. I can imagine hubs forming around types of businesses for example: cafes, breakfast, dinner, auto, gas, clothing, etc. And locations, for example: going on vacation to island. Since the community is small, it might makes sense to run a hub for all their transactions. Or a particular town, or a popular street like Soda Sopa, in South Park. There could be hubs for all sorts of things.. Its basically limitless. If we actually think about our finances and where we spend money each month, its as easy as budgeting... in fact, it does your budgeting for you. EDIT: nice to see the downvote brigade is active today.\n",
      "[Showerthought] for many they say they want decentralization and to help achieve that we must stay at 1mb because its harder to run a node that is >1mb. But the shower thought is that if we want Bitcoin to free us from financial constraints (banks, etc) we will want to use Bitcoin as a currency. Do you really think people are only going to transact via their full nodes at home? No, they are going to use their mobile phones to transact which can means they are using some sort of centralized service/wallet. The wallet makers, exchanges etc can/should run nodes. Those that can or want to run nodes from home can, but the network shouldnt force it on those that dont have a desire to. Why would I run a full node if I just want to transact? There is no benefit. I will also leave that up to the pros. Do you really think the unbanked in Africa care about running a full node? They just want to transact on their flip phone for a low cost. \n",

      "A lot of people here are being concerned about Bitcoin blocks getting full, they believe that full blocks imply that Bitcoin is over the capacity and the system will collapse unless an action is taken. But if block space is valuable, blocks _should_ be full as long as marginal costs of adding more data to a block are below the price users are willing to pay for their data to be included. And block space is valuable. Whether you like it or not, the Bitcoin blockchain can be used to store and publish arbitrary data. It can be regarded as a replicated, persistent, immutable, highly-available, censorship-resistant decentralized data store. These qualities are necessary for Bitcoin to work, and they can be also tremendously useful for many other applications. Why bother building your own decentralized data store if you can just use Bitcoin? Building your own system is hard, expensive, and I would argue its nearly impossible to replicate Bitcoin qualities. On the other hand, building something on top of Bitcoin is dead simple. What are these applications? Most natural choice is asset ownership tracking systems: Mastercoin (Omni), Counterparty, colored coins, Ascribe and so on. These things already exists and are used to transfer millions worth of assets. But theres more  proof-of-existence/notarization  information publishing, e.g. [Eternity Wall](  [BlockStack]( A Key-Value Store on Bitcoin, used for DNS, PKI, and identity management on the blockchain.  [BlockCast]( Documents are compressed using DEFLATE and then embedded across up to 16 Bitcoin transactions in OP_RETURN outputs allowing for total compressed size of no larger than 1277 bytes.) This is enough space to contain a number of document digest formats, URIs and URNs. This allows for cross-platform content addressable formats between systems like BitTorrent and IPFS. Used by openpublish. Imagine we remove block size limit and somehow optimize the system to allow miners to include as much data as they want without negative consequences. Transaction fees will be negligible in this case. In this case the Bitcoin blockchain can be used for, well, everything. Your twitter account was banned because somebody didnt like what you wrote? Post on the Bitcoin blockchain, nobody can ban you as its censorship-resistant. Government cracks down on file sharing? Lets post torrent links (together with meta-data, ratings, etc.) on Bitcoin blockchain, good luck shutting it down! Somebody DDoSes Wikileaks? Why not publish information on the blockchain! (This is all unbelievably cool, but who pays for all this? Bitcoin users who run full nodes, they have to download, process and share all this published information. As more data is published, it becomes harder to run a full node, so fewer people will be able to verify transactions directly.) But even if we put data store use cases aside, theres still a lot of competition for block space. Microtransactions. There is a demand for transferring tiny amounts of money, sometimes just for shits and giggles. E.g. Satoshi Dice, originally this gambling service operated like this: to make a bet, you send bitcoins to a certain address, and some time later service sends back money you won, or one satoshi meaning youve lost. This way, you dont even need a web site to play (web site can be closed by US government which for some reason hates gambling), you only need a Bitcoin wallet to play. At some point Satoshi Dice was responsible for the bulk of Bitcoin transactions. If transaction fees were negligible, wed see a lot of gambling and betting activity happening directly on chain. Besides that, there are things like Bitcoin faucets (people get tiny amount of bitcoins each time they visit a site and see ads), micro-tipping, and ideas like paying to a web page to remove ads. (Of course, all that can be done off-chain, in principle, but why bother if fees are negligible and you can do it on-chain?) As Pieter Wuille once wrote: \"I believe demand for payments in general is nearly infinite\". Thus normally blocks should be full, as there is normally enough demand to fill them up.\n",

      "Everywhere you look these days theres an article about the collapse of Bitcoin. How this block limit is going to kill the Bitcoin economy and send the bitcoin price to the potato. Everyone is saying \"We have to raise the blocksize yesterday!\" As if there are hords of people trying to use bitcoin but cant due to the limit. Im here to tell you its all garbage. We could eliminate the block limit tomorrow and make blocks limitless or leave the 1MB limit for all eternity and it would not impact the success of Bitcoin. Markets are like a flowing river. No mater what you put in its way it keeps flowing. Lets explore a world where the block size is never enlarged from its current state of 1MB. Like any market when the supply is limited and the demand is growing, the price goes up. Like a river flowing in a small canyon between 2 mountians, the depth of the water goes up to handle the amount of water. With only 7 transactions a second the price of each transaction will rise. Making sure the most important transactions go through. This will change bitcoin slightly for the short term. The Bitcoin network will be used for large money transfers and micro-payments will go away (temporarily) because they are too expensive. With enough people using bitcoin it may even become too expensive to buy a meal at your local restaurant that excepts bitcoin. I know what youre thinking. \"Micro-payments are a huge advantage bitcoin has\" and \"If retailers stop taking it we wont be able to spend it and it will kill the bitcoin economy.\" Youre not completely wrong if you thought of those but those things will put pressure on developers to develop side-chains and off-chain transaction solutions. Bitcoin will be used to buy cars and houses instead of coffee. It will be used to transfer large sums of money instead of tipping your favorite podcasters. If a restaurant or a podcast host wanted to keep taking bitcoin, in the short term they could have multiple POS (point of sale) systems so if their customers use Coinbase then they can take off-chain Coinbase transactions for free instead of a on-chain transaction with a large fee. If the block limit is never raised bitcoin will take a similar path as credit cards did. It may only be used in an emergency (like I need to transfer money in the next hour or my car gets repossessed), or if youre traveling outside your native country or you need to buy a car. Smaller credit card transactions at gas stations and McDonalds are relatively new. McDonalds only started taking credit cards in 2002. Many of us forget that our parents had credit cards for emergencies only, much like the early cell phones. Now what if tomorrow morning you woke up and the Bitcoin protocol was back to how Satoshi Nakimoto wrote it to be, with no block limit at all. What would happen... Mining would centralize (in the short term). But is centralizing pressure really bad? We think of bitcoin as decentralized therefore it is good and any pressures leading towards centralization would have to be bad. But thats a false dichotomy. Theres a huge difference between a system that was set up to be centralized and one that was set up to be decentralized with centralizing pressure. When it comes to the former only the central authority has power. And everyone must appeal to that central authority to become active in the game. With the latter there is no central authority to appeal to. Anyone at anytime can join the network. It may become more expensive over time but anyone with the means can join without permission from anyone else. As more and more people would use bitcoin the percentage of would be miners to users will shrink, but the overal amount of miners wood grow. If there are a million Bitcoin users and only 1% are miners then there would be 10 thousand miners. Now if the user base exploded to 100 million and less than 0.1% of those people were miners we would have 100,000 miners. No one in their right mind would call a 100,000 miners a centralized network. Without any limits on the block size supply of transactions is unlimited and would be very cheap or even free. Bitcoin would be like a wide shallow river running through a large piece of flat land. Micro-payments would be possible and there would be no need for side-chains or off-chain transactions. Miners would determine the block size individually and mining companies would succeed or fail based on what limit they use. If the market pushes limits down then side-chains and off-chain transaction will be incentivesed again. With smaller fees and no limit we could handle a lot more transactions and with larger adoption we would be using the Bitcoin network for everything from a cup of coffee to a $0.05 tip to your favorite podcaster. Regardless of what happens, whether the river flows through a narrow canyon or a wide open field the water is going to keep moving and its going to go where its going. No amount of obstacles will stop it. And eventually the river will carve a canyon out of a field or a field out of a caynon until it reaches its optimal depth and width.\n",

      "[Link to full speech transcript]( Relevant excerpt (context is a discussion on the proposals to ban/restrict cash usage, which Weidmann generally opposes): > All eyes may be on cash right now, but it would be unwise to ignore the far-reaching changes that may well transform the area of cashless payment systems at some point in the future. > Blockchain technology is seen as the key innovation in this regard, allowing as it does values to be transferred cheaply and comparatively anonymously, while bypassing centralised authorities such as banks, card companies and clearing houses. > Similarly, I can also well imagine that it will soon be possible to use digital currencies, such as bitcoins, which are based on this technology, to trade in financial products, such as shares, bonds or derivatives in decentralised systems. This would, of course, present a challenge for the existing payment and settlement systems. > It therefore stands to reason that not only financial service providers, but also central banks are investigating whether this very interesting technology is actually suitable for mass use. This is why the Bundesbank is, inter alia, also a member of a working group on this topic at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel. The BIS having a working group on the topic of blockchain technology was news to me. \n",

      "Hi r/bitcoin, I have a question (its at the end if you dont feel like reading). So, in a scenario where I am the merchant doing business in-person, I wouldnt accept RBF transactions, right? I should think theyre too high risk, especially if a customer can alter their payment immediately after they walk out the door, and if I dont get the CPFP window, I lose the transaction, right? Paredo-not-optimal. This must mean that future wallets will require an on-off RBF switch built into every single wallet, or else we are basically using two different kinds of currency and cannot interact, all because one person could not produce a safe 0-conf transaction. Not everyone even wants to hear about bitcoin, let alone how to act in a contentious RBF situation. Should all wallets be required to have simple RBF on/off controls and very clear alerts, even SPV wallets, in the future? I think yes, unless we scrap RBF completely. \n",

      "For all of you BTC price watchers out there, I wanted to share a potential chart pattern that might have formed. Over the past 4 months, the price has been marking off lower highs and higher lows, converging closer together towards a point (sort of like a pennant shape). [There are some rules to give this formation validity:]( 1) Huge price movement prior to the formation on heavy volume (this happened in late October) 2) Decreasing volume as the price consolidates and marks off lower highs and higher lows (we have seen this) 3) Duration - the time frame for this move (4 months) doesnt meet the rigid definition, but this wouldnt necessarily invalidate the pattern. It could just be a larger scale pattern forming. If this pattern plays out, a target price would be somewhere in the $700 range. It looks like a breakout could occur within the next month, since there isnt much room left in the chart before the slopes of the pennant converge. Anyway, just wanted to share a fun hypothesis of mine. Im aware this is pure speculation right now.\n",
      "We dont always need to know the solution, or in this case the exact moment in which the tipping point will occur. However we might find value by highlighting inevitability of its existence. We often seem to forget that we all want newcomers to find and appreciate bitcoin. We seem to equally forget that bitcoin will grow to fuel and foster mass adoption, or at least we hope it to. In some ways this can be seen as a double bladed sword, because on the other hand this brings mass ignorance to the movement. The ignorance is also sustained, if adoption continues and or grows. But there is only a finite amount of people in this world, and/or, there is only a finite amount of people over time. This means that as bitcoin and the crypt-anarchystic ideology it brings with it begins to pervade larger networks of our global civilizations consciousness there is an implication that the ignorant \"energy\" that is seemingly continually and perpetually sustained is not at all to be continual or perceptual. Over time, it will run out. And therefore at some point it will \"tip\". Then we will begin to understand the problem, and so the true nature of bitcoin. In many peoples eyes it will change; bitcoin will grow or evolve (and unfold), its implicate order. \n",
      "Just overheard a guy say to his friend: \"Sorry man, cant post that photo of our kids together on Facebook. Morgan Stanley monitors our social media and its such a pain to comply with that I dont even bother with it.\" I lived under exactly these types of restrictions for 20 years as a FINRA member. If you have, for example, the Series 7 General Securities Rep (Stockbroker/ Financial Advisor) license with a major firm like UBS or Merrill then you will: - have all email monitored by your firm - have all your personal holdings and finances monitored by your firm - need approval for any outside business activity- from investing in a rental property to volunteering at a homeless shelter - need approval for all written communications and advertising - need pre-approval for any speech you will give BEFORE you give it - if its short notice you wont have time to have it approved Etc. etc. Essentially all actions are subject to complex and often conflicting compliance processes. Basically this is the world that the pro-regulation folks are proactively asking for for Bitcoin when they ask lawmakers and regulators to be more involved. Not surprisingly, the people pushing for this type of regulation have never actually been regulated or worked in a regulated industry. They read about regulations in books. They have no clue the damage that excessive regulation can do to an industry and have a naive belief that if you somehow give the regulators more significance and power that eventually their appetite for influence will subside. It wont. \n",
      "The results of the fee event (last Monday when some users had stuck transactions, blocks were full, fees went up temporarily, and Bitcoin got a ton of bad press) has somewhat changed my view on the blocksize issue in the short term and Im wondering if anyone else feels the same way. Ive supported increasing the blocksize for years. I have passionately argued with Core developers on here and bitcointalk about all the dangers of not adapting fast enough, pricing out use cases (and users) while Bitcoin is still in infancy and adoption is relatively low, and scaring off people who will only continue investing if they believe Bitcoin will be actively developed. Ive spent maybe thousands of hours of my life reading and discussing this issue. I understand very well all the dangers of full blocks. I know that when blocks are full its cheaper to attack the network (which is, effectively because you are only buying the marginal remaining capacity). I know that the Bitcoin user experience absolutely sucks and is made much worse by poor software that cant cope in these situations. I knew that Bitcoin was going to get a bunch of bad press and attention might shift to alternatives. And yet, the actual event itself has opened my eyes to a few things that I want to mention here. Things that I think are actually important and possibly are being ignored by a lot of us who support larger blocksizes. 1) Many wallets completely failed to correctly calculate the appropriate fee and the users of those wallets got screwed. The ones that didnt have this problem worked just fine. That to me speaks to the immaturity of those wallets and the need for the market to force them to either be upgraded or replaced. The fact that Bitcoin has been around for 7 years and wallets still have a hard time calculating the appropriate fee is ridiculous. Perhaps the fee event was a good thing in that it showed users (who were aware of what was happening) that they should switch wallets and put necessary pressure on software developers to improve. 2) Along those lines, it appears that some companies are making horrible use of the blockchain. I did 7 withdrawals from Coinbase all within a short time period and that resulted in 14 blockchain transactions (because I understand coinbase does 2 transactions for each withdrawal) when it could have only been 1 total if the transactions were grouped. Now Coinbase did pay a fee for all of those, and its their decision to do so, but Im having a hard time with agreeing with Brian Armstrongs posts when his company is significantly contributing to the issue. He should come to the space with \"heres what we have done to help scaling and its still not enough\", rather than purposely exacerbating the issue. In fact, why doesnt Coinbase have engineers submitting tested performance improvements to Core? What has Coinbase contributed to the core software at all. This is a meritocracy. Make things better and then people will listen to you. 3) Things did settle down and go back to normal a few days after the event. Appropriately priced transactions worked fine. Anyone using adequate software was not affected outside of a slight fee increase. This was certainly not the doom and gloom that a lot of us thought it might be. In fact, it was a decent test of what happens in the worst case when many users are using shit software and nobody is being efficient 4) Price has maintained largely despite all this shit. Its even up 10% since Hearns rant. Thats a really good sign that at least the market isnt that worried. Going forward, wallet developers need to get it together. Coinbase should submit beneficial code. Alternative implementations should attempt to compete on features and performance. TL;DR I guess things werent as bad as I was expecting. Bitcoin definitely is resilient.\n",
      "Ive been a lurker for about 6 months, but was compelled to post this morning. Ive been a casual observer of bitcoin since 2013, but only recently started dabbling with buying and selling. Ive been a customer of Coinbase for around 8 months now. During that time my limits have been steadily decreasing until it was unusable. My daily limit was dwindled down to less than $100/day. To my surprise I got an email from Coinbase today stating that my limits have increased to $1000/week instant buy, and $10000 daily limit. Whoa! Even my friend, who had his account suspended due to non activity, had his limits increased all of a sudden. I was wondering why this sudden change of heart from Coinbase? But I think its more sinister than what it appears to be. I would recommend all Coinbase users to look at the last few transactions out of Coinbase. Look at the Input wallets and network transaction fees. My last 3 tranactions out of Coinbase were crazy. Normally the input wallets are 1 or 2, and the network fees around .04 to .08 cents. But the last 3 transactions had input wallets from 11 to 30, and network fees from .35 to .95 cents. I tested this again buy buying $20 instantly and transferring out. Again 12 input wallets and over .40 for network fees. Is this a way of Coinbase filling up blocks ASAP and increasing the network fees so we would demand Classic right now for 2mb increase? \n",

      "Hey guys, Im doing a project for a college course and as part of the project were suppose to discuss the merits of Bitcoin. While introducing the topic of Bitcoin and the Blockchain I was trying to explain it in terms that a person who has no knowledge of the subject matter would understand. Below is what I came up with. In relation to the blockchain – This is the underpinning technology which bitcoin and other similar applications use to function. On a basic level it works as a system designed to remove the need to trust the other party in a transaction via a method called triple entry. The need for trust is removed as every node on the network has a ledger which tracks each transaction, if a transaction does not match the other node’s ledgers it is stopped from being processed. The nodes are made up of each computer on the network i.e the computers belonging to people using the blockchain. I dont feel this really works as a lay person explanation, any tips or suggestions as to how to improve this would be appreciated. \n",
      "The concept of blockchain technology and its various apps is currently overhyped while bitcoin’s role of money is underestimated. If we focus on developing blockchain security and the money application for bitcoin then all other apps will come easily afterwards. Instead many developers are distracted with second stage apps like smart contracts and verifiable data which have limited practical value until a secure and decentralized blockchain with a high valued tokens is established. In addition, banks and tech giants are competing to create private blockchains and VCs impatiently finance lots of promising projects blockchain projects without any sign that they will really work. It seems like we are designing the fruit of a tree which still has a tiny stem. We should rather focus on growing a robust trunk with deep roots and only then discuss the beautiful apps that can be built on top of it. It may sound boring but we need more people devoted to the plain old problem of bitcoin used as money. Blockchain apps are important game changers but they will remain a mirage unless we have the foundation of blockchain based widespread digital currency. Going back to basics is especially important in the context of the block size problem which currently slows bitcoin’s adoption. Let’s take a closer look at what makes a blockchain work. The blockchain could be used mainly for two things — transferring value and timestamping information. For these to work properly we need the highest level of trust and security possible. Security is the main requirement for any blockchain which claims to be useful. It comes from fierce competition for the role of a temporary third party for a valuable prize. Actually when people say that there is no third party in blockchain transactions they are wrong. The third party is the miner publishing the block with our transaction. The revolutionary thing is that this third party is paid well for the service and is constantly changing because of the mining competition which is open to everyone. Therefore blockchain security equals fierce competition and fierce competition equals freedom for everyone to compete for a high valued prize. blockchain value = security security = competition = freedom to compete  prize for the winner Consequently, private blockchains which are not open for everyone to compete are inferior to those who are open. At the same time, the high value of the prize is also crucial for the competition. If the prize has zero value in an open competition there will be no participants and no security. In the bitcoin model the prize is currently 25 bitcoins + transaction fees for every block. So valuable bitcoins bring more security and additional security feeds more value in an ever growing spiral. Widespread adoption also yields more transaction fees which add up to the prize. So… Prize for the winner = block reward + transaction fees = bitcoin price + number of paid transactions per block = demand - supply of bitcoins + widespread usage = widespread usage - supply + widespread usage = 2x widespread usage - supply (fixed schedule we cannot change) Therefore… Prize for the winner = 2x widespread usage => blockchain value = security = freedom to compete + 2x widespread usage where 2x widespread usage = world’s most frequently used blockchain app = money => the ultimate blockchain winner = freedom to compete + money So the prerequisite for all the promising blockchain apps is the first and main app - money. Consequently, bitcoin must become the most secure and user friendly money in the world. Then, progressively more people will be willing to give away government currency for these digital tokens and use them as a payment now or store their value for future payments. In conclusion, money is the most crucial app for the blockchain technology. In fact, it is so important that it dwarfs all the others. Most efforts of the blockchain community should go towards helping the bitcoin system achieve maximum durability, highly fungible units and user friendly experience. EDIT: The point of this article is not to open the blocksize debate. It is to show that private blockchains are not very useful. Also the thousands of blockchain apps people get excited about are much less important relative to the plain old money function. However, it will be hard if not impossible to create widespread usage while limiting the number of transactions.\n",
      "The popular metrics for valuing bitcoin are legacy moneys, but ~~if~~ when faith in legacy moneys falters, these metrics completely lose their meaning. Bitcoins are forged in a proof-of-work process that eats energy. While value is subjective, energy is the most universal desire and therefore the best analogy to objective value. (Bitcoin also eats energy÷time or power, but this is not a good metric for the value of bitcoin because 1. its a time-rate and 2. its highly dependent on block reward which is scheduled to halve every four years) I propose we measure the value of bitcoin with total energy eaten by bitcoin (teebb): a logical and sustainable metric for a money created from energy. To calculate take the time-integral of the hash rate divided by average active mining rig efficiency, (both of which can be estimated to varying degrees of accuracy). Energy = ∫(Hashes/second)÷(Hashes/Joule) Has anyone tried to calculate this number? If not, has anyone tried to estimate and graph the efficiency of mining rigs over time? (this would be a good first step.) Edit: After more consideration I believe the main metric well use to measure the value of bitcoin in the future will the free market price of energy in bitcoin. Where I live this is currently about 250 J/satoshi or 7000 kWh/bitcoin (converted from $CAN0.08/kWh.) Over the long term I expect [this metric to be more revealing that $/bitcoin, which could go asymptotic ~~if~~ when faith in the USD is lost.]( That being said, Im sure there would be cool insights to be gained from charting teebb!!!. \n",

      "Anthony from Kryptokit here. We’ve added two major, in-demand features to the latest version of our Jaxx Bitcoin wallet, v0.0.13. This update is available for all platforms on [our website]( Jaxx can now transfer funds from paper wallets, either with the multi-function quick access camera button or by entering the address manually. We’ve also added the ability to view a list of (and export) the used public and private keys generated by your master mnemonic. This feature has can be secured by the security PIN option we added to the last Jaxx release. In addition to these features, we’ve also introduced a Tools section into our Menu, where you can find now find the Back Up Wallet section, the device-pairing tools, and the new Paper Wallet feature. In a post I made a few weeks back, I pledged that we would be announcing our open source license for our Jaxx wallets, as well as publishing our code online. Choosing a license has turned out to be more complicated than I envisioned - we still need to consult with other parties and seek further specialized legal counsel before the determination can be made. I apologize to the community for this delay. We are still committed to making Jaxx open source. In speaking with the community, it’s become obvious that the most important thing we can do in the interim is to publish our code. I can now announce that the code for Jaxx’s back end is now available to view in its entirety on [our website]( We decided on this publication method because while we want users to be able to scrutinize how Jaxx operates and be sure our apps do only what they’re supposed to. Users who want to verify that this code is the same as the released apps can cross-reference it with the viewable code from the download files of the Android mobile/tablet and Chrome extension versions of Jaxx. The code for subsequent Jaxx releases will also be uploaded to our website as they are released. We hope this will put to rest any concerns users may have about our products, but if not, please feel free to direct any additional questions to me on this thread, or via info@kryptokit.com. Thanks as always to the whole community for your feedback and support. We’re grateful for the feature suggestions and requests we’ve received so far, and we’re always looking for more. Changelog for Jaxx v0.0.13: All versions: Transfer Paper Wallet feature added Display of used public and private keys feature added Tools sections added to Menu Reminder: Jaxx is a beta product. Please stick to amounts you’d be willing to lose. \n",

      "Open source projects that an industry uses typically require some form of stewardship. Whether it is a package manager (cocoapods?) or a server side framework (Node.js?), or an entire OS (linux)! Otherwise they stagnate and die at the first incompatibility. Now we have open source consensus based projects that things are built on top of, and this hasnt happened before. Thank you for the stewardship and spearheading development! I would like to ask, what kind of stewardship would you like to see for a consensus based project? There are limitations in the upgrade path of bitcoin, and in other blockchain networks the upgrade path is typically controlled by one person. I can foresee the emergence of multiple clients, acting like a parliament that contains many parties, instead of a supermajority. But I havent seen anything like that in a blockchain network so far. Despite the stewardship through Blockstream and the requirements of its business model, I dont foresee their Core devs maintaining a supermajority forever. So given the passion towards the project you share, and we all share, what structure of stewardship would you like to see? For instance, in event that your client is unable to maintain meaningful influence on the bitcoin network, or if you had to pass the baton another way for some other reason, what kind of diversity or flexibility would make you comfortable with how the network maintains itself?\n",
      "Lets say I am a bitcoin business with a big customer base and want to change the bitcoin protocol, because the current protocol does not fit my needs very well. I find other big competitors with the same goal and they join me. First, I set up my own infrastructure (miners, full nodes, wallets) which implement a protocol change. The trick is avoiding hundreds of million dollars for mining equipment by changing the hashing algo in a way that allows me to mine a block every 10 minutes easily. It would cost me orders of magnitudes less than hundreds of million dollars. Then I fire up my miners, leading to a hardfork of the blockchain and I can mine easily block after block with the changed protocol. The key here is the wallet, not the miners. I offer my services through the new wallet only. My competitors do the same. Users are pretty much cut off from exchanges and payment providers unless they upgrade their wallets to the new protocol. Users can still transfer bitcoins p2p on the official blockchain, but that pretty much it was (it must feel like in the early days of bitcoin). The other miners cant attack my blockchain, since their sha2-miners are useless for that. It will take them too long to set up significant hashing power with the new protocol. So how would that work out? Or why would it not work out? \n",

      "They are mentioning the block-size issue and Supporting Bitcoin Core devs stance on bitcoins future(More decentralization)!!!. Note: See their SXSW discussion (this years not last years) Edit: here is the link: \"From our perspective the most important and true superhuman power of Bitcoin is decentralizaton and that is it. ACH can and will get faster and cheaper. That advantage over time will get eroded. Decentralization is truly what seperates Bitcoin from everything else. If you increase the blocksize so much that only miners will lot of resources can mine the Bitcoin network then you start limiting the amount of people who can mine and it becomes more centralized and more like an expensive version of Paypal. Thats really where the tension is: people that wanna do a lot of throughput and TPS, make a better VISA to buy cup of coffees with Bitcoin around the corner, at risk of centralization. Then there is other people saying: \"Look: its ours to screw up, weve gotta be very cautious. We want to increase it but slowly and how to do that ? We feel decentralization is sacred. We cant screw it up, have to be very cautious. I think we tend to lean more on conservative side.\" Cameron Winklevoss - Mar 12, 2016\n",

      "Im interested in making a 2 of 3 multisig wallet so I can give private keys to family for security. I made 3 paper wallets and used their public keys to make the multisig on [Coinbin]( For those who might not know you basically just give it some public keys, choose the required number of signatures and then it spits out a new wallet address and a redeem script. I understand that the redeem script is used to sort of reconstruct the metadata of the multisig wallet, essentially describing the terms of releasing the funds (ie. 2 of 3 signatures required from the private keys associated to the following private keys: ...). So of course you use the redeem script to allow you to make your transaction, which then needs to be signed by 2 private keys, which then needs to be broadcast to the Bitcoin network. It all works, but Im a little confused as to the significance of the redeem script because Id never really heard of it before I started investigating how to use multisig wallets. Is the redeem script something to ensure absolutely that its backed up? Can a multisig wallets funds be recovered if the redeem script has been lost? It seems to me that the redeem script is sort of overlooked (or at least under-talked-about) as a very important component to a multisig wallet, and you should be as careful about backing it up as your private keys (with the difference being that the redeem script doesnt need to be hidden/encrypted, only saved).\n"

      "Hello. I’ve been trying to learn how the bitcoin protocol’s working “under the hood” and it seems that there’s a big level gap between different tutorials. Some are aimed for the relatively non-technical users, while the others are highly technical and complex. So after I spent some time going through various tutorials and documentation and was finally able to use the raw bitcoin protocol using (almost) native python code, I’ve decided to create my own video tutorial. - Explaining something is the best way to understand it. In this tutorial I’ve hoped to achieve something like a “codecademy” tutorial. Aimed for people with very basic understanding on the way the bitcoin protocol works. So far I’ve created 2 videos at a length of 35 minutes and 45 minutes. The first one deals with messages and connecting to peers - I’ve constructed a Version message and sent it to another node on the network. The second one deals with keys and addresses. I’ve created a private key and showed the steps that are required in order to go from that private key to bitcoin address. I’m currently working on a third video which will explain how to create a transaction (This video is quite a challenge to make, But I’ll hope to complete it soon). I’ve tried to create the type of tutorials that I was looking for while I was learning this topic, and I’ve purposely tried to keep the code as simple as possible. I must admit that this is my first attempt in making such a tutorial and I’m feeling somewhat insecure. I believe there’s a room for improvement and I’m willing to make some corrections. That’s why I’ll appreciate any type of comment you might have. Here’s a link to the videos: And the code on github: Thank you.\n",
      "The green movement is pretty powerful these days around the world. They claim the moral high ground and receive billions after billions from governments in order to fight for things like reducing carbon dioxide emissions. We as bitcoiners should utilize that movement to push for deflationary money, because there is a very simple argument that we can make by using their own keynesian rhetoric. Let me put in that I myself do not believe in the keynesian theory, but since the majority does, they should accept the following: Inflationary money encourages spending. More spending means more goods and services need to get produced, which is harmful for the environment in many different ways. Just think of the carbon footprints! Deflationary money on the other hand encourages saving. When people save money, they are deferring consumption. Because of less consuption, a smaller amount of the worlds precious natural resources are used. The carbon footprint sinks! The world is saved! Next time you meet the leftist greenpeace activist in your circle, try and see how they respond to that logic. Dont they care about saving the world?\n",

      "Maybe Im not seeing the problem here, but it my past visions of bitcoins future I saw corporations and entire countries doing their best to mine as many bitcoins as they could, and trying to wrestle as much control over the network as they could. I never saw this as a violation of the bitcoin economic \"rules\". I always thought bitcoin would remain decentralized because other countries would see this threat and step up their game out of fear. And the free market competition would continue. Mining decentralization, as I always saw it, would effectively end up as a competition on the megacorporation/government/nation-state scale. I never had a problem with single player and small organizations being run out of the mining and node game. In a bitcoin global takeover picture, how could such small players possibly matter? Is all the talk about mining centralization and changing the PoW to stop ASICS really because the rules are being broken, or because China is simply winning the mining game right now? In my opinion, everything is fine. Western countries just need to invest more resources into mining to balance out the power.\n",

I would propose that Bitcoin adopt a similar system (optional feature: peer interrogation/web of trust for 0 conf). Bitcoin has been suffering from a perception that little innovation is being moved forward because of conservative development.

      "We just pushed our latest update to the App & Play Stores: [iOS]( & [Android]( Wanted to give everyone some details on the update & some of our reasoning behind our decisions. We launched “Lawnmower: convert your spare change into bitcoin” a little less than a year ago & now we’re finally getting ready to move beyond what we view as just the first iteration of our product. We loved the attention garnered and ease of explanation from using the familiar “spare change” concept & applying it to a new investment that we obviously love – bitcoin. But as we once dreamed, we’d eventually move beyond both “spare change” & just bitcoin, and into a broader & more full-service platform. In this update, we’ve removed “spare change” and replaced much of the branding and screens centered around this concept, and in place have some brand new functionality, screens, and hopefully a much smoother user experience. In the new update, you can now set up a totally customizable Recurring Purchase (similar to how your “spare change” automatically made you passive trades over time), as well as Buy & Sell bitcoin directly from the Lawnmower app with your linked bank account. The dashboard is now completely re-vamped, and we have a bunch of statistics on a fresh new “Analytics” page with a bunch of cool data on your account & trading performance. We have a brand new logo, an optimized and smoother sign-up flow for new users, and an easy transition for existing users where we’ve provided an estimate of your previous weekly “spare change” volume that you can use to set up a similar recurring purchase. Another huge reason for the move away from “spare change” is to broaden out our infrastructure to set up for a large international expansion we’ve been talking about for some time, which we’re currently testing now. As you can also see from our “portfolios” tab, we’re also currently focused on expanding out our asset offerings beyond just bitcoin and providing you an easy way to invest in much broader portfolios of crypto assets – more info TBA :) More information on our update & reasoning can be seen on our recent [blog post]( and some explanation on the figures on our new “Analytics” & main dashboard can be seen on our [accompanying blog post]( where you can also quickly see some screenshots from the new app. We appreciate all of your support over the last year and hope you continue to follow us through our progression into a much broader and full-service investment platform for what we view as an entirely new asset class. Let us know what you think of the update and thanks again. If you have any issues or run into any bugs at all please reach out to support@lawnmower.io and let us know. Were always here to help. \n",

Also the next question I wanted to ask is If i was looking into mining myself from home, obviously Id look into buy a new rig with all the specs needed etc, how would I go about this? Is it a case of downloading an application and clicking run and letting it mine for me or is it much more complex than I first thought?

      "What you write here could be a potential future, a parallel universe if you so wish. A creative concept, ideas, thoughts maybe even a prophecy... who knows.

Hillary Clinton - Would also listen to the \"Bankers\", and also work against the Bitcoin, corruption will run deep so tech companies will pay her to delay a outright ban of Bitcoin. Bernie Sanders - Would support the Bitcoin as he sees this as an even distribution of future wealth for the people. This would cause the \"Bankers\" to instigate World War 3.

      "If someone had access to a production ready docker container management system, and cloud server management system how useful would that be to startups and people in the Bitcoin industry? For those of you who dont know what a Docker container is, it is essentially an application wrapper you can put around almost any application. These wrappers can even be encrypted, and you can even encrypt the container management system itself, and offer no DNS capabilities which makes it very difficult to hack. It seems to me like an encrypted Docker management system running Bitcoin applications could be interesting, but personally I dont have enough Bitcoin knowledge which is the reason for this post. I know tech like this has been deployed by major banks for traditional currencies, but Im curious what everyones thoughts are here on using Docker containers? Could you use docker for mining?

You can base your pick either on:  Most used/popular (according to number of users and/or your daily routine)  Most understandable/familiar user interface (mostly personal opinion)  Write down any other reason for your pick Second step: Based on the information i get i will create a short survey to try to define why a specific platform is good and understandable to the user/trader and which of its elements are either good/great or should be changed/optimised.

I would like to say first, that i am not fan of Core or r/Bitcoin or Classic /r/btc...I am still not decided which team of developers i would choose if i had to... However, i found out that the claim Blockstream = Core is quite false and there is a lot of FUD flying around... As you can see easily on the Blockstream website, there is a list of members working for Blockstream: To the comparing i used credits/ list of contributors, who contributed to the latest Bitcoin Core 0.12.0. release. You can find it here: The true is that some of the Core developers really ARE working for Blockstream. On both lists i have found: Matt Corallo Mark Friedenbach Gregory Maxwell Gregory Sanders Patrick Strateman Jorge Timón Pieter Wuille 7 coders are on both lists... I counted that to the 0.12.0 Bitcoin Core release contributed 94 coders... So 7 coders out of 94 coders are employees of Blockstream... I think also important fact is, that to the 0.12.0 Bitcoin Core release contributed also Gavin Andresen, who i see personally as most trustworthy person in bitcoin development. So when people say Core = Blockstream, you are forgetting the rest -> 87 coders...You are forgetting that there are 87 coders out there who are working on code to make your/our bitcoin network better and safer and who must take all the negatives and critisicm from community. It is really thankless job and i kind of feel for them. Once again, please check the list of all contributors to Bitcoin Core releases before you get your opinion that all Core devs are working for Blockstream, because it is simply not true...

      "Slush pool miners are now forced to take sides in the Classic/Core competition or have sides chosen for them, \"non votes\" or \"dont cares\" are assigned a side based on the ratio of active votes. This seems a little un-ethical, to me so Ill explain: There was a large number of non voters, and \"dont care\" voters, these are people who are unaware, too busy, undecided, or simply apathetic; now depending on how the votes went, I would assume there is a higher number of Classic voters, since Classic people tend to be much more vocal and politically active at the moment. We know Slush himself is pro-Classic, and thus might have an interest in steering his pool in that direction. So this decision is probably being made because it will favor Classic by steering the uncommitted non-votes to classic where otherwise they would have stayed on Core For example: say of the active votes its a ratio of (2:1) (Classic:Core) and of the \"non votes\" (100 miners) who are currently mining Core blocks. That would mean that if the pool steers 100 non-votes to match the active votes (2:1) he has turned 100 Core miners into roughly 33 Core miners & 66 Classic. He is covering his ass by posting a blog post to announce what he will be doing to give the non votes a chance to pick their own sides.

      "Hi folks, Id like to hear anyones experiences with MaiCoin - good, bad, or anywhere in between. The use case will be primarily for sending bitcoin to Taiwan, and immediately converting to local currency through a linked, local Taiwanese bank account. This is for a non-tech savvy older parent in Taiwan, so all the steps, from buying the bitcoin with dollars, to sending to the MaiCoin address, to selling/cashing out into the local Taiwanese bank account will all have to be done from the US. Ideally they will \"magically\" see one day they have more money in their account. Thanks in advance\n",
      "Theoretical question: Imagine a person picked up few thousand USD worth of Bitcoin back in the super early days, when it was pennies. Say he shoved it all into one address. He wakes up from a coma and realizes hes a Multi-Millionaire! Over One Hundred Million dollars. He decides he wants to diversify his massive wealth, but how does he do it? He must expose his one private key in order to transfer the bitcoin, therefore wisdom dictates he must completely empty the address all at once. But how? Where could he put that much bitcoin temporarily while he takes the time necessary to further distribute/diversify it? Coinbase? Would they let him? Would it be wise? Should he generate 10,000 distinct addresses and shuffle $10K worth of bitcoin into each one? It would take weeks of manual work, meanwhile his original private key is exposed from the get-go. In short: Is there a way a person could either sell, and/or diversify so much bitcoin without running the risk of losing it, or getting stiff-armed by various exchanges because of their deposit limit rules etc? Appreciate the thoughts in advance. And just to be clear, this really is just theoretical, unfortunately :) \n",
      "Why does LocalBitcoins tell me that to buy bitcoin by using LocalBitcoin over TOR, my bitcoin could be stolen because of certain exit nodes. How is that possible? I plan to deposit cash into the sellers bank account, the seller then sends bitcoin to my LocalBitcoins wallet, I then move the bitcoin from LocalBitcoins to an offline wallet. How exactly can a rogue exit node on the tor network steal my bitcoin purchase if I have the above plan?\n",
      " TOKYO -- Bitcoin, a leading example of financial technology, or fintech, is posing a challenge to Japans existing financial system. The Japanese government recently adopted a draft law to treat the virtual currency, currently considered a commodity, as having the same functions as legal tender. Some financial institutions are already starting to adopt cryptocurrency technologies. In late February, DMM.com, an online streaming service with 19 million users, began accepting online payments in bitcoin. This one move raises the prospect of wider bitcoin acceptance. DMM.com also sells comic books, games and online English lessons. \"In Japan, bitcoin is starting to be used to settle small transactions,\" said Yusuke Otsuka, chief operating officer of ResuPress, which runs the bitcoin exchange coincheck. DMM.com uses coinchecks settlement service. The number of shops in Japan that accept bitcoin payments was around 1,000 at the end of last year. How do consumers use the cryptocurrency? Well, in December, a 30-something investor in Hong Kong bought a condominium in the coastal city of Atami, south of Tokyo, for some 500,000 yen ($4,351). She paid in bitcoin and saved about 5,000 yen in processing fees that a bank would have charged. In addition, the cross-border payment was settled in an instant, bringing convenience to the process, she said. There are an estimated 12 million bitcoin users around the world; 50,000 of them are thought to be in Japan. For a time, the cryptocurrency was used for speculative purposes. But, thanks to its ease of use and lower fees, it is increasingly being used by overseas students and immigrant workers transferring money across borders. The trend has prompted the Financial Services Agency to see bitcoin in a new light. \"The proposed regulations are designed to promote healthy businesses,\" one official said. The proposal would not only give bitcoin currencylike status, it would also try to protect consumers. Yet it is hard to predict to what extent the virtual currency will actually be used, and creating a legal framework is not an easy task. The bitcoin issue dominated a Financial System Council meeting in November. \"Do we have measures against money laundering [involving bitcoin]?\" one member asked. There is global concern on this issue as well as on keeping cryptocurrencies from becoming a tool helping terrorists operate in the shadows. Bitcoin issues will likely be on the agenda at the Group of Seven summit meeting, to be held in Japan in May. In Japan, bitcoin scams are already rampant, with the elderly being the primary target of unlicensed brokers. The number of such cases rose about fivefold in 2015 from a year before to over 200. With the collapse in 2014 of Mt. Gox, the worlds largest bitcoin exchange at the time, and the subsequent arrest of its top executive, any similar incident that harms the bitcoin community could jeopardize the virtual currencys future. This is financial regulators conundrum -- to allow the cryptocurrency to prosper while safeguarding users and society.\n",
      "I have been reading and considering buying bitcoins for literally over a year. Its kinda funny because I am addicted to watching the price of bitcoin going all over the map. But from a noobs perspective, bitcoin is still too complicated. For you guys who are above average or very tech savvy the blockchain is probably so simple, but to the average Joe this stuff is way to complicated. Now people see ( and again i could be wrong) that there is Bitcoin classic, some other bitcoin?, nodes, wallet, codes, blockchain etc. Then they walk away confused. And now, conversely, banks are making it easier to get and give money at relatively low rates. I can send anyone a few hundred dollars for like $2 at my bank by email (Canada). I have also visited London and could take out money out of any ATM on the PLUS system. Anyway, in conclusion egghead geniuses, please make bitcoin more easier so simple homer could buy and spend bitcoins and watch it grow.\n",

Afterwards, I search for trades in \"Brooklyn, NY\" and look at the full list and his name does not appear.

Its tokens are however worthless, as they can be incorporated, later, at no cost, to the more valuable, more secure Bitcoin blockchain. Niche uses can be accommodated via siechains and benefit form Bitcoins relative value stability. Practical examples like Blockstack and Rootstock prove this. Additionally, the security argument above is complemented with an economical one: The entire cryptocurrency ecosystem benefits from limited supply1, but alas altchain proliferation is incompatible with this property, unless the case where only mainchains worth is nonzero. ( 1 Even stronglier, this is often stated as one of the key reasons that make cryptocurrency tokens valuable at all; a point could be made for limited regressive inflation, but anyway altchain proliferation has unlimited inflation.)\n",

I wanted to buy some now and its insane how much overhead there is. It takes weeks just to get verified on a site, and you have to disclose every ounce of personal info.

      "It looks like most of the major wallet services like Coinbase require government-regulated verification of government-issued identification. We cant declare our own identities and find private ways of verifying, according to these services. It makes me extremely uncomfortable because the most valuable part of BTC is its security - in being anonymous and independent from government. Coinbase solves one anonymity issue by changing your BTC address every few months or every transaction. And they never reveal this info to others. But I also found the site bitlaunder.com, which completely disconnects your identity. The only issue beyond that is the fact that the place where my precious BTC is stored is tied to my government-issued identity, which makes it all too easy for the government to plug in and extort money or steal it. Do we have alternatives? This makes me really angry that the first popular and fundamental services would do something so dangerous and irresponsible for their community.\n",

      "So, Im looking for feedback on best practices for bulk production of paper wallets. Currently, Im using an strong encrypted hard drive on a computer that is not connected to the Internet (and never will be again). The computer was a clean install of Windows; I downloaded the necessary software for my applications and then took it off the Internet (it was only ever connected for about 10 hours). Im using [bitaddress]( to generate the bulk wallets, and saving the output to a .csv, Excel, and Word to get the output I want. Im printing the wallets using a dumb, mid 2009 printer with 16mb of memory, and Im tracking it dumps the memory every time I turn it off. After every production run, Im deleting the .csv, the Excel file, and the Word document, deleting all temporary files (particularly those used by Office) emptying the recycle bin, and running cipher /w: to overwrite any deleted files. Anyone have any feedback on security concerns with this process? Between deleting all data used to generate the files, using a printer with a small amount of memory, and wiping my free space on the disk after every production run, I feel that the private keys and addresses are irrecoverable other than using the actual wallets I create. I feel like the fresh install of Windows, encryption, and non-Internet connectedness adds about as much assurance as possible that no one else could get the private keys. My only thought is that someone really sneaky could theoretically pull some private keys off of the transfer roller, fuser, or toner drums by physically breaking into my location and using some kind of technique. But I think that would only reveal a fairly small number of recently printed keys, correct? I would love not to produce any files, but that just isnt an option for my application, and I believe that this protocol is very secure. I welcome any feedback you may have.\n",

(Or course I thought the worst.) I did receive an email a few hours later from Eric Larchevêque, CEO of Ledger. He said.... We are currently experiencing scaling issues with our backend API (the system used for the Ledger Wallet Chrome app to access the blockchain). Our engineers are currently working 24/7 on the problem and we are hoping for a quick resolution. Your bitcoins are not at risk and your private keys are staying fully safe. We are perfectly aware of the difficulties these issues may be causing you, and you can be sure that all our team is on deck even on a Sunday morning.

      "My analogy is as follows. Blockchain = tcp/ip (base structure of the internet). Bitcoins = domain names. Pretend its 1992. 1) IF the Internet (tcp/ip) becomes the global platform used for media and communication then domain names are inherently connected with tcp/ip and therefore are basically the same thing (interdependant). 2) IF a decentralised global competitor to the internet takes over and becomes ubiquitous then that protocols domain name system will become valuable and interdependant with the prevailing \"internet\" protocol. 3) IF a mesh of private closed intranets become the chosen way to do digital communication then no domain system will be relevant or valuable as there wouldnt be a globally connected internet to register them on. In the exact same way but with bitcoin. 1) IF Bitcoin becomes the global platform used for Blockchain applications then \"bitcoins\" are inherently connected with the bitcoin blockchain and therefore are basically the same thing (interdependant). 2) IF a decentralised global competitor to bitcoin takes over and becomes ubiquitous then that protocols native token will become valuable and interdependant with the prevailing global blockchain protocol. 3) IF a mesh of private closed blockchains become the chosen way to do digital value transfer then no crypto currency will be relevant or valuable as there wouldnt be a globally connected blockchain in use. If the bitcoin blockchain becomes the globally chosen platform of trust and value transfer, then bitcoins will be interdependant as you require bitcoins to access and write to the bitcoin blockchain. If society chooses a different global blockchain platform OR chooses to use a mesh of private closed blockchains then bitcoin will be removed from blockchain usage by virtue of simply not using the bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin and \"bitcoins blockchain\" are inseparable but depending on how this space evolves and what societly chooses as its preferred blockchain usage method, will determine wether bitcoins will be used or not.\n",

      "Back in January I started looking into some strange voting patterns affecting several users who noticed their comments were routinely downvoted within a minute of posting. Some of these users had already reported the issue to reddit admins to no avail, so I wrote [a little script]( to continuously refresh the latest comments and measure how long it takes for each comments vote score to change from the default 1 point. Some users reported being affected when posting in /r/btc, so I included that sub as well. I finally started logging on January 30th. With the recent downvote attack against /r/Bitcoin, I figure now is as good a time as any to share this information.  Method  Stream reddit comments and record how long it takes for the vote score to change.  If the vote score changes within three minutes, record whether it was an upvote or downvote.  If the vote score changes within roughly one minute, consider it potentially anomalous.  Tally data to isolate which accounts are most frequently affected by anomalous changes to vote score.  Results What I found was rather alarming. It didnt take long to see that virtually all the comments by several dozen regular contributors appeared to be getting downvoted to 0 points within about about a minute, regardless of what they said or how old the thread was. And since I wasnt only measuring downvotes, I also found that a number of accounts had their comments change to 2 points within the same time frame. You can view the results in this [Google Spreadsheet]( Please note that one sheet contains the data, while the other 3 sheets contain charts of the data. At least one chart didnt import from Excel correctly. Since January 30th, /r/Bitcoin has received over 10,000 instant votes:  For 12,451 comments, the vote scores were changed within 180 seconds  10,309 comments had their vote scores changed within 60-80 seconds  2,137 of those 10,309 comment vote scores were changed to \"2 points\"  8,123 of those 10,309 comment vote scores were changed to \"0 points\" Its important to note that this activity is observable at all hours of day and without any noticable interruption, except when affected users are not commenting. This even occurs when commenting in very old threads with simple test comments.  Charts Chart 1: [Frequency]( This histogram shows the number of comments where a vote score change was detected (y-axis) within n seconds of the comment being made (x-axis). The anomaly is the massive spike in vote score changes under ~80 seconds. As the anomaly dissipates, vote score changes appear to be much more organic. Regretfully I didnt save any data logged from comparison subreddits, but they just look like this graph minus the huge bubble. Chart 2: [Targeted Users]( Heres a histogram based on frequency of specific users affected. Blue bars indicate the number of comments a user made whose vote scores changed to \"0 points\" within 80 seconds, whereas Orange bars indicate the number of comments a user made whose vote scores changed to \"2 points\" within 80 seconds. Bars which are more evenly split between blue and orange can be ignored as inconclusive. Longer bars of unform color are more indicative of something weird. Chart 3: [Activity]( This shows the number of comments affected within a given hour per day over the course of logging. It shows that this activity has gone on around the clock as long as people are online and commenting.  User targeting The most alarming thing about this data to me is that specific users are being targeted, apparently based solely on their political views. I have not monitored how this might effect comment sorting, but its certainly plausible that a comment with 2 points will have an advantage over a comment with 0 points, potentially distorting reader perception. I want to stress that a user having their comments instantly changed to 2 points is not conclusive evidence of any wrongdoing on the part of that user. Its admittedly strange, but could be explained by an obsessive fan upvoting all their comments as soon as they post something, or perhaps some unknown reddit mechanism.  False positives False positives can occur during fast-paced threads where readers are frequently refreshing for threads for the latest comments and replies. Its not uncommon to open a thread and see a comment posted within the last few minutes, then cast a vote. However, given the amount of data accrued and patterns observed, its seems pretty clear that false positives dont weigh heavily on the results.  Vote fuzzing Vote fuzzing is one of reddits anti-vote cheating mechanisms which causes vote scores to fluctuate randomly within a narrow range in an attempt to obscure the actual vote score. This can be observed by refreshing a comment with around 5 votes or more, and watching the score randomly change plus or minus a few points. However, to the best of my knowledge, comments with a default vote score of 1 point do not get fuzzed until after it receives a few votes. Sometimes you might see vote fuzzing on controversial comments, as indicated by the little red dagger† (if enabled in prefs). You can verify that default vote scores arent fuzzed by commenting in your own private sub (or a very quiet old thread in the boonies somewhere) and see that the vote score does not change when you refresh. I have no reason to believe that vote fuzzing applies to the data Ive collected because Im only logging the first change to the vote score. That said, it does not rule out the possibility these anomalies could be explained by some proprietary anti-vote cheating measure which reddit does not wish to disclose.  Admin response Reddit admins are generally pretty responsive when it comes to isolated cases, but this issue took a few weeks to address, presumeably due to the bulk of users affected and investigation required. They have confirmed that theyve dealt with multiple accounts targeting these users with downvotes, but have also caution against drawing firm conclusions from this method due to various anti-vote cheating measures in use. Reddit admins have neither confirmed nor denied whether automated voting is taking place. It appears to still be happening, but the frequency has abated somewhat.  Other subreddits I looked at a few other subreddits of comparible size and found that votes occuring within 1 minute are rare by comparison. In fact, I extended the scope from 3 minutes to 15 minutes, and still did not find any anomalous voting patterns. Fast votes do happen, but I have yet to find any sub where they happen as fast as on /r/Bitcoin, nor have I found a sub where it appears specific individuals are targeted. I also looked at some much larger subs whose scores are not hidden (GetMotivated+mildlyinteresting+DIY+television+food) and found that while votes do roll in a bit faster, they still do not occur within seconds of commenting, and still do not appear to target specific individuals. Theres room for more research in that area. ___ Edit: Ive asked the mod team if theyd object to disabling the temporary hiding of vote scores for a few days in case anyone wants to run the script for themselves. No objections, so comment vote scores are now visible for the time being. The script requires Python 2.7 and PRAW. Provide your own login credentials. ___ Edit 2: Weve seen a couple attempts to claim responsibility. [This is the most compelling so far]( ~~Heres the [data he posted]( [Updated link since it was deleted]( A very quick glance reveals that its very similar to mine, but I need to look into it. Most compelling is that his earliest logs were before I started recording. Im now even more convinced by the multiple bot theory than before. Everyone doing this should knock it off because youre only hurting your cause.\n",
      "I have over 10k USD in bitcoin wallet. Its spread across multiple safe wallets. One of them is the andriod bitcoin core wallet. This wallet has many transactions, and its only about 8 months old. When I try to do a restore, it takes about 20m to sync.

So i sended again ( this time successfully ) 5.2 sent 3. then send the rest 1.2 to my other wallet. Balance was 0.

I was thinking of trying bank cash deposits on Lbc, maybe at a couple different banks around my area with around $1,000 per transaction. Ive also thought about using LibertyX. Ive never ever tried them before. Would this be an option for me? The only thing is that every location around me is at least an hour away. They all also only do transactions of up to $300 a time with four pins per day. Whatever that means haha. But any advice would be great.

      "Is there anyone working on either a decentralized deep learning algorithm, or a consumer facing app that uses AI to help people diagnose themselves? My wife was just diagnosed with CVID a couple of weeks ago, its like AIDS except its not Aquired, its part genetic and part environmental - but its a rare primary immunodeficiency disease. Shes had this her entire life. Shes 33 years old, a wonderful mother to our 5 year old daughter, and beautiful singer, actor and writer. She was misdiagnosed 3 or 4 times, most recently she was eating gluten free for the last 8 years because she was diagnosed as celiac disease. Shes lost most of her hair over the last 6 months and has been in the hospital 3-4 times this year. It turns out, she never had celiac, she has always had CVID. Where Deep Learning fits in. My wife should have been diagnosed in her childhood years, in fact, all it would have taken was a simple blood test to measure her antibody levels, and an Immunologist appointment. With all of her symptoms, her medications and blood test results - a deep learning algorithm would have been able to suggest a proper diagnosis in a few minutes instead of the 30 years that it took for her to get properly diagnosed by just letting doctors do their thing. The problem with diagnosing rare diseases: CVID affects 1 in 25,000 - 50,000 people, its a rare disease where patients present with a myriad of symptoms and autoimmune problems. Its hard to get a correct diagnosis because a patient typically sees many different doctors to treat the different types of symptoms, and they don’t typically share information efficiently - nor do they have an incentive to properly diagnose her. There should be a visually appealing, easily marketable app that combines machine learning and crowdsourced input from app users to give the \"hot/cold\" direction that will greatly improve time to diagnose these \"zebra\" cases. The average lag time for CVID diagnosis is 6-7 years. This is common with most rare diseases. If my wife was diagnosed even 2 years ago, she would not have lost all of her hair. The treatment for my wife’s condition is IVIG every 2-4 weeks, and it greatly improves quality of life and life expectancy. The earlier a rare disease is diagnosed, the better the quality of life. The problem with doctor-facing AI solutions: I see that there are some machine learning startups, but they are mostly targeted towards health professionals. There’s resistance from doctors to adopt AI. The problem is that this technology needs to be available for the patient, not just doctors, and not just specialists at John Hopkins or the Mayo Clinic. Nobody is going to be as motivated and investing in someones health as the person and their loved ones. Quite often, patients with diseases become more knowledgeable than the specialists treating them for the disease. There’s a lot of knowledge to be tapped into there from the zebras themselves. Potential barriers to a centralized organization providing this solution: The FDA and drug companies are resistant to technologies that allow users to diagnose themselves. 23andme ran into issues with this. They just finally got FDA approval in October to start helping people agian ( Some existing projects: A friend who sold his company to Salesforce for 70 million dollars introduced me to this TED talk shortly after my wife was diagnosed, where Jeremy Howard explains how deep learning works, and it’s potential applications: Jeremys company Enlitic is using deep learning to help doctors come to a proper diagnosis faster, currently only focusing on radiology. Again, its just doctor-facing. www.findzebra.com is a search engine that you can input your symptoms, it uses something similar to deep learning to suggest possible health issues, but it doesn’t use AI. It crawls and indexes only curated medical sources. Jeremy Gardner & the Augur guys introduced me to www.crowdmed.com which is a great solution for diagnosing rare diseases, but costly. CrowdMed is a site where you tell your story, and then it uses crowdsourced knowledge to come to diagnosis suggestions. You pay a monthly fee of $299 - $749 a month, and then “medical detectives” investigate for you, and their predictive market algorithm ranks what the detectives submit. Vitalik Buterin of Ethereum told me about www.numer.ai which is a competition that uses homomorphically encrypted machine learning to let people try to predict the stock market. It’s a way to anonymize data, to alleviate some concerns about people’s medical data being publicly available. Xprize even has a $5 million dollar prize up with IBM Watson for AI Theres also openai.com, with names like Elon Musk & Sam Altman attached, its a non-for-profit with a billion dollars committed, but they havent yet released what their focus is. Potential solution to being blocked by FDA etc: Decentralized deep learning on a blockchain, where users are rewarded tokens for providing the hot/cold and running the network. Think ethereum, bitcoin, etc. In my limited understanding of machine learning, it seems that for a deep learning algorithm to learn, humans need to give it hot/cold inputs to the correlations it comes up with as it compares datasets (Jeremy’s ted talk video explains that) My theory is that a decentralized deep learning algorithm on a blockchain could be built where the people giving hot/cold inputs are awarded with a token for doing the mechanical turk style work. When consensus is achieved, the people who were correct get rewarded. Similar to how Augur’s reporting system works, or bitcoin’s proof of work. If users are rewarded for giving correct hot/cold inputs to help the deep learning AI learn about subjects, there’s a financial incentive to keep the network running. Companies, individuals, universities, etc could tap into the algorithm to use it for whatever purpose they want - and they would pay to use it. IE I want to build an application that uses deep learning to help diagnose rare diseases so people like my wife don’t have to suffer going undiagnosed and untreated their entire lives. I would pay to have the algorithm learn about the human body, how it works, diseases, treatments, etc. The users of the network get paid to \"train it” with hot/cold inputs. Is there anyone working on anything like this, whether it’s centralized or decentralized?\n",
      "Just got a forfeiture letter from DEA saying 56k was seized and out of it, 23 dollars was mine. Have no clue what this is about. I googled name and bit floor came up, but dont recall using this service. Anyone else get a letter like this? It came certified 3/21 and said seizure took place 1/21/16. Any advice? Says since its drug related I have to petition to get money back. Not worried about 23 dollars but want to know more before I start any steps....also it listed an anboy bank and acct .... Thanks In advance.\n",
      "Personally I think payment will be integrated in every sort of structure where I can currently send someone a text message, so in every form of messenger. Global payments from a fraction of a penny to millions of dollars will be transferred instantly and for free. Most online businesses with subscription fee models will become pay with 2 clicks for what you want to get. Most ads on the internet could also probably be replaced with small Bitcoin payments. Mining chips will be in every device, making money a computer system resource. Through this, machine to machine payments will introduce to world to an economy where a network of servers will be able to run simulations by receiving micro payments if someone needs more computer power. Similar example of this principal (21: ping): With ananomous micropayments the distribution of illegaly copied movies/softwear/music/ etc. without many malware will become profitable. Machine to machine payments will allow things like mesh networks, therefore the use of the internet will be possible by simply charging a given device, since we said mining chips will be in every device ;). Or given wifi spots could sell their bandwidth (think airports/railway stations). TV ads could also be skipped by paying with Bitcoin. Since a person simply has to have an internet connection to instal a wallet and receive payments, billions of people in poor countries will have access to financial services all of a sudden. This will unlock the knwoledge of these people into the global economy. Think this way: Lack of Education/skills are by far not the only reason why some countries are less rich than others. For example bad institutions, lack of infrastructure, opressive regimes, lack of legal protection, corruption etc. Therefore if these people would come to countries with better possibilities to be productive, these people would earn much higher salaries. With Bitcoin these skilled people can sell their productivity (or export) to richer countries. remittances... These are some quick thought about the future Any other ideas? I would like to concentrate on use cases for Bitcoin the currency, since its much easier to understand. Thanks for your help\n",
      "1. Scaling up and beyond 100,000 TPS without centralization; 2. Incentivizing full nodes; 3. Preventing miners from becoming centralized; 4. Governance system based on user votes which doesnt give extra weight to the richest; 5. Decentralized buying/selling system; 6. Anonymous by default, with the option to show all transactions if the user wishes to do so. 7. Decentralized funding of developers based on the amount of work they have pushed to git, possibly in the form of escrow multisig payments, when accepted. 8. Mining power currently secures the network by solving mathematical problems, why not solve protein folding instead or something similar which a certain altcoin does? IMHO, bitcoin has got a lot of things right, it just needs the above, so no need to switch to an altcoin if the above can be achieved.\n",

      "As I am sure most of you know, there is an alternative incompatible Bitcoin implementation called Classic, which is trying to change the Bitcoin consensus rules to increase the blocksize limit to 2MB from 1MB. What I think many people do not realize is that Classic activates as soon at 75% of blocks flag support for Classic in any 1,000 block period. That means at the time of the activation there will always be around 25% opposition from miners and that Classic can never activate with more than 75% support from miners. Statistically Classic is more likely to activate with less than 75% support, as if support slowly approaches the 75% level, then Classic miners are likely to eventually get lucky and activation will occur before 75% support. Has anyone looked into the maths of a 75% activation threshold? I tried to run the numbers in the chart below. I assume Classic has activated and that a Classic miner first publishes a 1.1MB block, which gives Classic a one block lead. I assume Classic has 70% hashing power, which is likely as Classic is more likely to activate when support is below the 75% level. (Is this 70% estimate reasonable?) Please see the following chart which aims to plot the probabilities of each chain being in the lead as more blocks are found. It shows that as more blocks are found the probability of the 1MB limit chain obtaining a lead increases, until reaching a level of around 21%. Is this maths correct and doesnt this represent a large risk if the hardfork is contentious?\n",
      "If we want to encourage consumer adoption of bitcoin as a payment system, my disaster story with Expedia and Coinbase surely cant be allowed to happen to others. The saga is almost a month long and still no end in sight as each side now points the finger at the other. TL;DR- I sent bitcoin as a payment for a hotel booking, which was never acknowledged by the Coinbase payment page, now Expedia cant find it, and neither side has a clue how to refund my bitcoin - even though I can see the proper amount sent to the correct address on the blockchain! Heres what happened: 1. Tried to book a hotel on Expedia with bitcoin. Coinbase handles Expedias bitcoin payments, so when you checkout using this method the Coinbase website comes up showing the bitcoin payment address and amount 2. I sent the exact amount of BTC requested, immediately 3. But then... the Coinbase payment screen never acknowledged the transaction and the timer counted all the way down to zero. I was redirected back to Expedias check-out screen to pay again, as if no funds had been sent at all! At this point I was taking screenshots and checking that my payment was showing on the blockchain. Yes, there was 1 confirm within minutes of sending the payment. Am I victim of the mempool backlog that was happening at the time? So I emailed Expedia my screenshots and explain what happened. Nothing but obnoxious robo-form replies. The suggestion? You must call in if you want to cancel and refund your booking. But I have no booking! I call in, spend an hour on the phone, and because they cant see bitcoin attached to any booking, they have no idea what to do and no way to refund anything. Expedias resolution? Email Coinbase. At this point I was offered a $100 voucher for a future booking. Nice but nowhere near what Im missing right now. I email Coinbase. They respond acknowledging they can see the transaction and even offer technical details, and suggest I email them to Expedia, because only Expedia can process refunds. Now Im doing the back-and-forth work between Expedia and Coinbase. Great. So I email Expedia again - nothing but form responses despite providing everything they would ever need to resolve the issue. The suggestion? Call the call center again. What a huge time waster! Back and forth more times. No resolution. Expedia support cant get over the idea that if there is no booking, then I could not have been charged out of my \"bitcoin account\". Im sorry, but I can see my payment right here on the blockchain! And need to talk to someone who understands bitcoin, but Expedia doesnt have anyone like that at their call center. Conversation goes downhill when they ask me to contact Coinbase for a resolution yet again. Finally, a ticket is opened with Expedias \"bitcoin department\" and Im told to expect a response in 24-48 hours. Its now coming up on two weeks and no response at all. WTF. Meanwhile, I go back to Coinbase for more advice, which is to email another support address at Expedia. So yet again I message another department at Expedia with the details of what happened. No response ten days later. So my fellow bitcoin aficionados, heres the problem. You have no recourse when you try to use bitcoin as a payment method in a world where a big merchant like Expedia can jack you around like this. A credit card at least has a chargeback process for when a merchant cant get their act together. And boy oh boy. Expedia’s customer service is in dire straits right now. Just look at the comments on their facebook page. I have to say if you send your bitcoin to any merchant using Coinbase (or another bitcoin “payment processor”), and especially to Expedia - be cautious. If something goes wrong you may lose all your money. Or at least hours trying to get it back. \n",

      "[Conjecture] What Im concerned about is that any sudden burst of popularity will of course result in lots of trading and therefore demand for the limited amount of block space. Say you want to cash in on a big price rise? Well, theres a good chance youll have to pay a hefty fee to move your bitcoins into an exchange to trade them - and that could result in a market with limited liquidity and an associated price distortion. Possibly not unlike the price distortion that occurred around the MtGox debacle. Interested to hear everyones thoughts on this. Its all very well pointing to block capacity usage now, but traffic is bursty as can be attested to by anyone who deals with web servers, road traffic management, power grids, data and phone networks, etc. If you dont have the capacity to handle the success scenario, then how can you succeed?\n",

      "BTC to XCP is like TCP/IP to HTTP 1) HTTP was built on top of the TCP/IP protocol Counterparty was built on top of bitcoin network/protocol 2) http uses TCP/IP as the transport layer to transfer information counterparty uses the bitcoin network as transport layer to transfer information. Actually the value in counterparty are a kind of information. The value in any blockchain is a kind of information that include UXTOs, tx hash, digital signatures. 3) HTTP does not necessarily need to be on TCP/IP. And theoretically, it can be built on top of UDP Counterparty does not necessarily need to be on bitcoin network. It can switch to whatever other blockchain, e.g Litecoin / Dash / Doge / Bytecoin through proof of burn. That is, you burn your XCP, and you will receive proportional amt of xcp in the new network Any financial assets on counterparty can be transferred to another blockchain as well 4) TCP/IPs value is only in its functionality to transfer data, nothing else HTTPs value depends on the amount of web appllications that will ever be built to faciliate real world businesses Bitcoins value can only represent the hash power/ security of the network, nothing else XCPs value depends on the amount of financial assets that will live on it and the amount of escrow that is needed for financial transaction on counterparty network and else 5) http positively affect the usage/value of TCP/IP. More apps that make http calls, more usage of TCP/IP counterparty positively affect the usage of bitcoin network and BTC value. More smart contracts on counterparty, more transactions on bitcoin network, more demand of bitcoin 6) it is not feasible to build web apps directly on tcp/ip the transport layer, you have to build them on HTTP it is not feasible to build smart contract, financial settlement directly on bitcoin network, you have to build in on counterparty complex system are always in the hierarchical structure. In that sense, ethereum, rootstock both wont work finally, bitcoin is the transport layer and counterparty is the application layer for a decentralized financial system\n",
      "I live in the US and have made deposits on Bovada many times in the past and honestly it was a real pain. Very few credit cards will work, some work some of the time but usually they will not work. If you are able to make a credit card work, there is a substantial fee (between 4 and 5% I think). This has left me in the past getting information from Bovada to make a transfer using MoneyGram. I get the information from Bovada, go to the drugstore down the street, get on the MoneyGram phone and give all the information, pay the cashier and get a receipt. I then call Bovada again to give a confirmation number. Maybe 30 minutes later (sometimes faster, sometimes slower) the funds are in my Bovada account. Obviously MoneyGram charges a fee, but Bovada was not charging an additional fee in this case. The bitcoin process was super easy (if you own bitcoin... if not, the hassle would be getting bitcoin in the first place... still easier than what I was doing). The funds showed up instantly and there was no fee from Bovada (it seems like I may have lost about 1% on their conversion calculation, but hard to tell exactly because the price of BTC varies across the exchanges). I have used Bitcoin in the past to buy things and honestly it was generally a little more trouble than just using a credit card or paying cash. Not necessarily a huge hassle, but not really an improvement over how I would normally pay. This was a very encouraging experience for me! Bovada is the biggest poker site for US players and it would be bigger if it were easier to make deposits, so hopefully this option will gain traction.\n",

      "How to make a boatload of money! BitcoinPay: a sidechain solution Bitcoins blockchain is almost full. An option to scale the protocol are side-chains. Some side-chains already exist (like elements alpha) and others are in developement (like Liquid or Rootstock) but none of them is ready today, nor they focus on money transfers and transactions. Despite the hype on programmable money the truth is that most people use Bitcoin as simple money and still lack the necessary culture and user cases for smart contracts. Therefore simple transactions are the most requested service as well as the main source of value for the Bitcoin protocol. For this very reason, a side-chain that focuses on payments and transactions, dropping the other features, will meet market demand and ensure substantial profits. The name should be something nice and cool. My suggestion is BitcoinPay (in the style of apple pay) but you can pick anithing that works. This specific side-chain should have these features: - Include necessary code only and drop all complex OP_CODE and things related to smart contracts. (at least for the very beginning) This will speed up developement. - Include a link to Bitcoins main chain with a 2 way peg (or with a federation untill core 0.12.1 is activated) - Have segregated witness (already implemented on the elements alpha side-chain) - Generate blocks every 15 seconds with a max blocksize of 2 Mb (to scale up to 80 times the Bitcoins protocol) - Use thinblocks technology to reduce critical bandwidth usage during blocks transmission (the code is already available on Bitcoin Unlimited) - Have both Schnorr and ring signatures (implemented respectively on elements alpha and Monero) - Have zeroknowledge proofs to enhance privacy (like Zerocash and elements alpha) - Use the sha256 algorithm and merge mining with the Bitcoins blockchain. (To ensure security on the side-chain) - To solve the Blockchains size problem checkpoints must be used. on BitcoinPay the chain will be cut beyond 6 months and replaced with a genesis block with all the older UTXO. In this way the chain will not grow over 2 terabytes even at full capacity. Its no longer necessary to keep all the blockchain from block 1 because security is guaranteed by merge mining. The remuneration from transaction fees must be split into 3 parts: 20% to remunerate investors, pay developers and promote sidechain. 30% to Bitcoins main-chain miners for merge mining 50% to BitcoinPays miners With these specifications the project is simple and profitable. The technology is there, the code is already written and you just need to combine all the features to release the side-chain. The project should also schedule a hardfork at least once a year using Ethereums mechanism. Mining gets exponentially difficult when you do not update the version. In this way it is possible to easily introduce improvements. This project can greatly enhance Bitcoins use for businesses and transactions, dramatically increasing its value. This idea also has few expenses, a low difficulty and potentially huge gains for programmers who will realize it. Just be the first, do it and do it quickly. \n",

      "I was thinking about how to secure a sidechain, and wondered if using a spacecraft could be helpful. Spacecraft have some unusual properties that might be helpful in anchoring a crypto currency: Spacecraft are comparatively inaccessible once launched 1. Could be designed to not have updatable firmware. 2. Firmware could be upgradeable based on voting. Only firmware with the \"winning hash\" gets loaded. 3. Governments cannot alter the behavior of the spacecraft by threatening people. 4. Spacecraft private key and other entropy can be generated through cosmic particle detection, and cannot be discovered by earthlings. 5. Difficult to disrupt spacecraft. Impractical to physically destroy. Cant build a fence to stop radio transmissions. What about jamming/blinding though? Spacecraft introduce a useful known communications delay 1. .28 sec round trip for geosynchronous satellite. 2.56 sec for moon L4. 2. If headers are beamed to spacecraft for signing, and headers commit to hash of previous signature, then you have a \"proof of time\" as the blockchain cannot have been created faster than the speed of light permits. Spacecraft could also timestamp blocks according to an onboard clock. 3. Spacecraft could sign merkel roots and produce proof of publication at a certain point in the past. It is expensive to make and launch a spacecraft 1. Acts as a filter so there arent lots of alt-craft competing to be the one true craft. 2. Construction could be crowd funded in return for tokens that pay dividends based on transaction fees spacecraft collects. Im not sure how exactly this would be made into a sidechain, but just off the top of my head, lets say that you had terrestrial minters who create candidate blocks and beam them to the satellite. Minters include a security deposit, which is lost if the block gets signed but was invalid. Satellite selects and signs a candidate block, using some criteria like stake or security deposit size. Usual problems with POS involving rewriting history are avoided because of the proof of time aspect.\n",

      "Hi guys, after 9 months I finally got a refund from Igot. Although the value of Bitcoin (4.5BTC) was now worth double than what I originally paid, I was still happy with a refund for $1400 which is what I paid at the time. ACCC - no luck (try the police) ACORN - no luck (try ACCC) ASIC - no luck (bitcoin not a currency - cant help you) Victoria Consumer Affairs - no luck (he hasnt commited a crime yet, his systems are slow, theyre in your account) South Australia Police - no luck (bitcoin not a currency, doesnt exist - cant help you) Consumer and Business Services South Australia - BINGO!!! (used the word INVESTMENT this time around, which I think helped) I had to do a lot of explaining to them about what Bitcoin actually was and they hadnt heard of Igot before (which is surprising). Anyway a few weeks later and I had my money back. If Igot didnt at least reply to their requests, the directors would be taken to court by CBSSA. Very serious proper legal threats the lady I dealt with told me. Rick Day that prick told them that Ryan (myself) failed to read their terms and conditions (bullshit), but he was going to refund my money to avoid legal trouble. Thats when I knew I finally had this guy. Anyway to start off youll need to: 1. Leave a message on CBSSA website for them to contact you by a mobile phone call www.cbs.sa.gov.au/ Theyll call on a private number so make sure you answer those types of calls during thi period. 2. Theyll call you. Explain what is happening and theyll ask for your email address to send you some forms to fill out and send in to them. 3. Later on another person (case officer) will eventually call you (was a couple of weeks for me) to talk more once they have received your forms of complaint. 4. Theyll send court action legal threat for Rick Day to respond. Rick will respond and they will give him a timeframe (1 week for me) to refund my money. Some pointers:  Say you have purchased an INVESTMENT (Bitcoin) and they are REFUSING to provide you with that INVESTMENT by not releasing your bitcoin into your online wallet. They are outright refusing to cooperate. Because the Australian government doesnt recognise bitcoin as a currency, dont call it a currency.  Ask for a refund for the real money (not the Bitcoin). You dont want his product or investment because its not real, its a con. Its a scheme. Its doesnt exist. You want your money back for false goods that never existed.  Remember to file a complaint against 13th Pty Ltd. They are the company (not igot , which is the website) get their details from \"ABN search\" if need be.

      "Does anyone know OXBTC? It seems like a new mining platform. A lot of my friends told me about this website recently. And I decided to take a try and buy some hash on it. I noticed it offers several discounts and a promotion now. Managed to get the lowest price lol… I don’t mean the 2% 6% 10% discount for big orders… I believe most miners would not buy more than 500GHS the first time…Let me share with you my strategy to get the lowest price besides the big order discount. First step: login your OXBTC account and go to ZeusHash Market (Halley A/B/C or Batch 3) – this is interesting cos they’ve transferred all previous ZeusHash contracts to OXBTC. Second step: place orders in the market to buy ZeusHash contracts. PS: Buy the same amount of ZeusHash contracts as the GHS02 contract you want to buy. Your bidding price per GHS should be lower than $0.008 (about 0.00002btc when the exchange rate is $400) if you buy Halley B/C, and lower than $0.006 (about 0.000015btc) if you buy Halley A or Batch 3. Third step: When the order is completed, click “learn more” of “ZEUSHASH OLD-FOR-NEW PLAN FOR LONGER ROI”. Remember, you need to purchase GHS02 on this page toenjoy a big discount under the transfer plan. Finally, you can purchase OXBTC GHS02 with a big discount of $0.008 or $0.006 per GHS. Call me clever!!!!~~~~~~ \n",
      "OXBTC recently released a promotional cloud mining contract with “A Price No One Can Compete With” as they state at only $149 per THS, which seems to be the lowest price among major cloud mining service providers globally. However, it is only a short-term promotion with limited supply as well for the most cost-efficient contract. From March 21st to March 30th, people will have a chance to purchase 100 GHS AT MOST for each account on www.OXBTC.com and they have a sales limit of 5 THS every day during the 10-day promotion. So first come first served. We’ve done a little comparison of the mainstream prices for cloud mining contracts. OXBTC does have obvious competition: Platform --- Price (per THS) ---- Minimum Purchase OXBTC.com --- $149 --- 1 GHS; CEX.io --- Trading Only --- Trading Only; Hashnest.com AntS7 --- $151 --- 4.86 THS (an S7 unit); Hashnest.com AntS5 --- $312 --- 1.155 THS (an S5 unit); BW.com --- $238 --- 10 GHS; Hashflare.io --- $220 --- 10 GHS; Besides the promotional mining contract, they are also offering major discounts on the currently sold OXBTC GHS02 contract. It is a good opportunity to buy some cloud hashrates at such a low price if you don’t have a big budget to experience another way of mining. Trading of hashrates on OXBTC market is available too if you want to sell out your contracts. OXBTC – a new cryptocurrency investment platform which offers both cloud mining and deposit services was launched a couple of months ago. Founded by several well-established investors in China, they have an experienced R&D team who has been in the cryptocurrency industry for many years. Benefited by a very competitive electricity cost and the economy of scale, OXBTC has deployed 3 of China’s largest mining farms in Sichuan, Ordos and Inner Mongolia. Till now, OXBTC has been running 5.6 PH/s hashing power with the electricity cost as low as 15 cents per kWH. Backed by partners that bring the most cost efficient Bitcoin/Litecoin miners in the world, OXBTC is able to provide the most stable and profitable cloud mining services. Despite the concern that cloud mining needs a longer term of ROI, it’s still not a bad choice if you want to mine for coins. And the special price OXBTC offers surely provides a good chance for you to make a small investment. \n",

      "I bought 3 of the Cryptosteel wallets through the original crowdfund. I understand [shipping can be a problem]( but losing all 80+ parcels is a little far fetched; especially while I see them being sold on BuyTrezor site. So, how is it possible I have not received my original crowdfunded Cryptosteel wallet, but they are being offered/sold through the partnership with Satoshi Labs? If in the US, I would be very skeptical of purchasing a Cryptosteel wallet until the original US crowdfunders orders have been met.\n",
      "The chinese have devalued the renminbi by the most since jan 7th. Why has bitcoin not moved up in price?\n",

      "Just noticed that all the private keys that I generate are starting with L or with K, is it still safe to use? I am generating addresses for a cold storage(got in the site, turned off my internet and then generated them and put them on a usb, plugged the usb out and then connected the internet again.) Suprisely all my Private keys are starting with either an L or with a K. Thanks!\n",

      "This is my experience with coinbase on a very slow buy process. I contacted them over 24 hours after my funds where removed from my bank account. Me (March 18): > Hello, I really enjoy using coinbase, especially the instant buy option, but this week I needed to buy more than the instant buy method allows. I realize I accepted that my transaction would take up to 5 business days to complete. The money for this buy was taken from my bank account yesterday, but my BTC is still on hold, presumably until Monday. At this moment the fact that I have this money in limbo is hindering me greatly. I would not ask for this to be rushed if the money was not already withdrawn from my bank account, but I would greatly appreciate it if the BTC could be released to me tonight. Transaction: March 15, 2016, 1.XXX BTC for $7XX.XX Thank you,  Coinbase - presumably automated (March 18): > Thank you for submitting your request. We have received your request and are working on responding to you as soon as possible. If you have any additional information to add to this case, please reply to this email. In the meantime, feel free to browse the Coinbase Community forum ( and visit our Support Center ( Thanks in advance for your patience and support. Coinbase (March 21): > Hello , thanks for contacting Coinbase Support. Your BTC will arrive by the end of day Today March 21st, 2016. Purchases with bank transfer usually take 4-5 business days to complete. Unfortunately, we still have to rely on ACH bank transfers to deposit and withdraw money from your account. While Bitcoin is very fast, banks can still be quite slow to process these transfers. If you need any further assistance, let me know. Regards  Coinbase Support Me (March 21): > This is the worst response that could have been given, I know how long it takes to send money through an ACH bank transfer. 1) March 15, 2016, at 8:12pm I requested to purchase 1.XXX$BTC for $7XX.XX 2) March 17, 2016, My bank sent $7XX.XX to Coinbase 3) ... Apparently coinbase wants to hold onto my money for 4 full extra days? This seems to suggest either incompetency or insolvency considering you just said yourself that the wait time is based on ACH bank transfer, which has been complete since the 17th. It would have been acceptable to release the BTC at the end of the day an the 17th or even the beginning of the day on the 18th. Expect this support request to be made public, I requested for support on the 18th and this response is made without any concern to the real issue and made three days later. I admit my last response was a bit heated, and that the BTC was released by the last moment that was initially promised, but their own support page says that the BTC is released as soon as my funds are sent by my bank. I am a long time user of coinbase, but I dont think I will be using them for anything other than instant buy option from now on.\n",
      "My name is Chris and I’m putting together a project for my undergrad class that looks at how Bitcoin’s price fluctuation effect trading volumes as well as the social dynamics which play into price fluctuations. The “interviews” will consist of an anonymous short (10 min) survey, or email chat (whatever you prefer) and I’ll ask you a few questions about how perceptions and interpretations of price fluctuations with Bitcoin. I would like to interview as many miners, traders, and regular day-to-day users as possible. Sadly, I cannot pay anyone but if there is enough interest I will post the finding of my research on here so everyone can see their contribution to the Bitcoin community. Thanks again, Chris \n",
      "On Monday, I purchased some BTC and decided to go with Coinbase because they stated the bitcoin would arrive on or before March 25th. The guarantee that I would receive my bitcoin before the weekend holiday was a crucial factor in my decision to purchase from Coinbase rather than Gemini, which does not have such an accurate estimation (at least to my knowledge). However, when I logged in today I found that the system actually stated that it would be arriving in two more additional days. I received no email notification from Coinbase. Furthermore, according to my bank balance the amount was already deducted. Has anyone else experienced this issue? Is Coinbase misrepresenting its guarantees in order to paint a more optimistic picture of bitcoin arrival times when in fact it takes longer or is my situation an anomaly? UPDATE 1 (March 26): Coinbase has failed its obligation as stated in the confirmation email \"Your bitcoin will arrive by the end of day on March 25, 2016.\" As of 12:00 AM PDT, I still have not received my order. Please upvote this for visibility as my attempt to reach out to support has so far been unanswered and my bank has already confirmed the payment. UPDATE 2 (18:26 PDT): Thankfully received a message from support: \"It looks like there was a small hiccup with the ACH process. I have reported this issue to our team so that they can investigate. Please let us know if you receive your order by the end of day Monday. If you don’t see your order complete by then feel free to reach out as soon as possible so that we can get this resolved for you.\" UPDATE 3 (March 28): ORDER ARRIVED. While I have to say that support didnt go above and beyond to help me or provide any sort of incentive for continuing to use their service despite the issue, they did at least complete the order and Rosey provided a much appreciated explanation. Rosey from Coinbase: \"Im very sorry that your BTC were not delivered on the day they were estimated to arrive. This tends to happen when orders are being created prior to the bank cut off time and actually placed after the bank cut off time. As mentioned by our support agent, please let us know if you have not received your BTC.\"\n",
      "After almost 3 1/2 years, it also continues to be a friendly place for new bitcoin users. And the reason why I post about here in /r/Bitcoin from time to time. Is as a reminder that there are indeed some non-reddit options for Bitcoiners. Something that sometimes many new Bitcoiners are not really aware of. \n",

      "At the end of every month, my startup sends payouts to select participants for top contributions. For the past 3 months, theres been 10 payouts per month, in sizes $100 — $3000. The recipients are all over the world, in countries like India, USA, China, Poland, and South Africa. Perfect use case for bitcoin, right? Until now weve given recipients the option to receive these payments at a Bitcoin or Paypal address. About 85% have selected Paypal. These are very smart and technically savvy people, but if theyre interested in bitcoin and already have a wallet, its only by coincidence. Paypal has a decade+ head start. But Paypal has been a frustrating experience. Aside from the fees, theyve tried to block our payments with vague \"This payment cannot be authorized\" messages more times than not. Its not an issue with our funding source, and when we call their customer support, they leave us on hold for an hour before asking us to log out and back in and try again. Polite, but unhelpful. This happens every time. This month, weve increased the number of payouts from 10 to 30, and will continue this trend. For this reason and others, we want to move over to a much more automated payout system. Wed like to do 100% Bitcoin payouts. Were big supporters for philosophical reasons, but ensuring our users have a good experience comes first. Ideally, they have no imposed volatility risk. If they want to convert their payouts into their local currency as soon as they receive it, thats their prerogative. And the whole experience could be as low friction as Paypal: 1) Tell us payment address, 2) Withdraw into your bank account. So what options are there to receive bitcoin and quickly convert into local currency? Were very familiar with online wallets like Coinbase and Bitgo, but these are only in limited countries. Some places have bitcoin ATMs, but not all. Abra could be promising if it ever launched. Is there anywhere that lists the options available for each country? And what can we do to make this more attractive to our participants? Suggestions welcome. Weve been thinking about this a lot, and super appreciative of advice from the experts.\n",
      "Contemporary advertising tries to create false needs, false desires based on extrinsic reward systems and immediate gratification. Why support that model at all? It does little to identify and attune with each unique persons intrinsic motivations to engage. If the aim of marketing design was flipped to elevate and support people and appeal to their intrinsic motivations for engagement, then truly people would pay for such a service. Why make people pay bitcoin not to see ads? Instead, why not provide the methodology for deep engagement through relevant products and services in attunement with each persons aspiring skills, talents and interests? This means you cannot only use past behaviors or purchasing patterns as the defining data (as objective and measurable as it is) to extrapolate future behaviors. To know what motivates someone from the inside-out, to support and grow radical personal responsibility necessary for decentralized self-organization, BRAVE and bitcoin will have to be committed to novel design that moves large human populations off standardized platforms driven by carrot-stick extrinsic reward systems and the dependency upon extrinsic validation systems (systems of control and conformity) and begin to design for radical personal responsibility. There is new cutting edge science emerging in this and it has everything to do with self-organization of chaotic systems and ensuing emergent patterns of engagement. Design synergistically with Natures patterns, dont bully and dominate her! Decentralization means we cut the ties of dependency upon centralized authority structures and design for self-determination and synergistic personalized engagement experiences. Browser experience should be determined by each unique individual from the inside-out, not mandated by outside vested interests, paid or unpaid. Be BRAVE! \n",

Installing the full client (like and having to download and process about 60Gb of blockchain. 2. Trusting some dude in a garage who registered ilovebitcoins.com and sign up for an online account. (Yes I know this is a bit overstated and coinbase probably doesnt operate out of a garage) In my view it would be nice if you were able to use a local client, but define your own \"genesis block\". Transactions from 2009-2013 have been downloaded, processed and verified 1000s of times. Why do I have to do that again when Im a new user? So the basic question is: is it technically possible to define another genesis block per installation and do we want this?

      "I posted this in another place, Id like to ask this here to work out if my understanding of the proposed Lightening network is correct. As I uderstand it, to make transactions using the Lightning network you first need to setup a channel and deposit money with the recipient. This means during the time the channel is up and running, my money is tied up until I either spend it or the time limit expires and the channel closes. Now either I only send a little money so I dont have to have too much money tied up at once, meaning many on chain transactions anyway (exactly what its designed to avoid) or I have to send a lot of money to cover a long period of time, meaning I cant spend it elsewhere. Where does this happen right now in the real world for most people? The majority of transactions right now I would say work on a credit system, using a credit card you make a transaction and clear the balance later by paying off the credit card. This is the complete opposite, as everything is pre payment. Alternativly you have a debit card and one account which gets debited immediately when you make a transaction. There arent many situations where ordinary people deposit money first with third parties to spend it later for themselves. Its like buying gift cards for yourself to spend later. The only way it might seem to work is if large organisations use the Lightnening network as a settlement system where huge amounts are transferred into holding accounts to allow transactions to be made between the organisations which can be settled at some point in the future. How about regular users? Pre payment cards for microtransactions? \n",

      "Hey everyone, I thought we should have an open discussion about this, as this has been troubling me for a couple days now since learning about the present situation uphold is in. Firstly, we should begin by understanding what uphold offers to its customers… Formally Bitreserve, Uphold is a financial service where you can do peer-to-peer remittance transfers with a wide range of different options including: USD to GOLD to BITCOIN (many more options avail) with them stating that all deposits that you insert into the platform are fully reserved assets and not subject to fractionalized reserve banking. The concept is awesome, as I can diversify by buying into the wide ranging of different asset classes that they offer, from national currency’s to crypto to commodities in one central spot. But it’s not what it seems… My curiosity here began when I noticed their new speculative VOX currency was on their balance sheet and counted towards its “Assets” against its “obligations to members”, in fact actually posted it here on Reddit, lots of traction arose from the post because I was just telling the truth. All I did was subtract the VOX currency from what would actually be accepted on a reserve statement and noticed there was actually a deficiency of $120,000! I didn’t make the post, as an attack on the business I was just telling the truth. As it was some sort of illusion to persuade people from realizing that there deposits were not actually fully reserved, but to upholds credit since my Reddit post they removed the speculative security from the transparency page and injected more cash into the system to run a surplus on customer assets (making it fully reserved) instead of the deficiency I spotted. Keep note, after I made the Reddit post their CEO acted completely unprofessional as instead of directly owning up to this sketchy flaw that I found he was on pure defense saying how much of a troll and dishonest I was, when in fact I was correct and they removed the vox from the balance sheet. Lolz. As I was, catching up on some Saturday reading this morning I decided to check out upholds website for the first time in a while, I have to tell you guys I’m still very troubled. As of 1:15 PM on Saturday March 26, 2016 I looked at their transparency page and ran my eyes through the present figures of how they come to their “assets in reserves” vs “obligations to members”. But first I just want to clear the air, fully reserve banking is defined as a financial institution that is required to keep the full amount of each depositors funds ready for immediate withdrawal on demand.. Uphold sort of fits the bill for the definition but in a very shady way. As of 1:15 PM today (Saturday March 26), they have $5,361,958.30 in obligations to members and $5,421,399.19 in reserves resulting in 59,440.89 in equity. So yes, everything seems great as they have more assets in their reserves than they do to the obligations to customers. But is it really fully reserved? As if we go back to what a fully reserve banking system is, it is something that can satisfy demands for customer withdrawals. So I will give you an example on why uphold is extremely shady. Today the company is LONG the British Pound ($728,323.25 < In Reserves TO $345,650.54 in obligations to members) also the USD ($2,351,714.54 < < In Reserves TO $1,615,814.12 in obligations to members) Uphold is SHORT the following: Bitcoin ($1,527,733.26 in reserves TO $2,027,827.23 obligations to members) Euro ($310,799.32 in reserves TO $528,088.65 obligations to members) and not fully backing customers obligations in the following: China Yuan, Silver, Platinum) now let me ask you something, is this a fully reserved financial service or a service taking great risks with customer deposits. What happens if the following scenario happens? I will just say Bitcoin, due to its volatility it will be a great example. So say, BTC surges 5% from $416.23 (Current Face Value) > to $436.96, unfortunately if this was to happen uphold would become insolvent.. because if it runs 5% that would mean the $2,027,827.23 in obligations to members turns into 101,391.36 in additional obligations to the btc holders.. their present equity stake is $59,440.89, so if the 5% takes hold the number would turn into a deficiency of $41,950.47 !! My message is simple, be careful with these type of financial institutions as even though they’re saying your deposits are fully reserved there still very much subject to insolvency due to the fact of very speculative bets by being long and short a variety of national currency’s or cryptos. and I wont even get into their strategies of long and short speculative bets of being terrible! Maybe another post for another day. Cheers/ Happy Easter. \n",
      "Hello /r/bitcoin, as you remember from this post we had 2 tournaments on Friday and Saturday. Both tournaments were finished and the results are pretty good. Lets start with the first tournament: We had 795 sign ups and a price of 300.000 bits ( 130$~ ). The competition was astounding, we didnt expect that. A lot of title player were involved. The winner: 1. 2. 3. Opperwezen refused his price so we added his price to the second tournament on top of the current pool. Most of the top 100 players are well known. We only had one engine incident. _____________________________ And here we go, the second tournament: ( We just finished it 2 hours ago ) We had 930 sign ups and a price pool of 1.000.000 bits ( 400$ ). The competition full of known and respected people. The winner: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. ( Berserk price ) Here we also had one engine user, he recieved a ban immediately. Both tournaments went better then expected. Very calm even though it was hyper bullet. _____________________________ A lof ot people were concerned about the engine use, these 2 tournaments are the proof that we can handle that. Everyone in the top 20 is well known. Even in the lower ranks almost nobody complained about engine users. The engine paranoia some people assume is a valid concern but you see the facts here. Thibault and his team is working very closly with us to detect every suspicious behaviour within the tournaments. We follow every report as soon as we recieve them. You guys gotta have some trust in LiChess and BitChess, we doing everything to prevent cheater and at the moment its working great so far.

      "This is a short essay exploring one possible direction for bitcoin if and when demand increased such that the market capitalisation became comparable in magnitude with an existing major currency or asset, such as gold, euros or dollars. So the basis for the discussion is that we got there - the market cap is much larger than today. How we got there could be from private demand initially, followed by government and/or central banks taking an interest, big investment banks... whatever. The key point Im making is that regardless of how we got to that point, once the market cap reaches a certain level, governments and central banks will take a significant interest in bitcoin. (From now on when I say government Im including central banks as being part of the government, i.e. a central bank is effectively part of the government even where technically/legally it is separated and partially autonomous - they arent really autonomous, theyre part of the wider system of politics and governance). So lets say the UK governmant is concerned that citizens are increasingly choosing to exchange sterling (Great Britain Pounds, i.e. GBP) for bitcoin, e.g. as a store of wealth in an unstable financial environment. The effect is large enough that sterling starts to fall relative to bitcoin. Lets say this same scenario is playing out in other major economies, the US, Canada, Europe as a whole, Australia & NZ, maybe India, South American countries, perhaps even China and Russia. I see two possibilities to consider. (1) Governments see bitcoin as a threat to their ability to govern, and/or their power, and a number of key governments are able to find a consensus and coordinate a campaign against bitcoin. I dont think bitcoin could thrive in this scenario, but I also think it is an unlikely one, because... (2) Governments see bitcoin as a threat to their ability to govern, and/or their power. No consensus can be arrived at between governments, possibly because in the background some of them have already conceded that bitcoin is competing strongly with their fiat currency, and are exploring ways of obtaining some controlling power over bitcoin, e.g. through building mining farms and buying bitcoin. This could lead to an arms race dynamic between governments competing to take control of miner share and to increase bitcoin reserves. Is this a sane scenario? A government would be losing its ability to control money supply, and although taking mining share doesnt necessarily improve that, it does mean that the money supply isnt being controlled by foreign governments. So they each maintain a share of the mining capacity to maintain a vote (or perhaps its really a veto on change) over bitcoin monetary policy. At this point I wonder if a fork would be coordinated such that western democracies would split away from China, Russia, etc. Perhaps it would be deeply incompatible to have governments and economies with big political differences operating on the same blockchain, and a fork is seen as a reasonably workable middle way. A fork might also be seen as a way de-escalate the arms race and reduce spiralling energy demand from mining. In the mean time, private mining can continue, but perhaps dwindles to practically nothing if the arms race between governments causes the profit margin to go negative (i.e. all mining is done at a loss). Discuss...\n",

      "Here is the interesting and relevant links/article. I may be missing some but I think you will find this relevant. Youll like to read this I think: Szabo explains that it is sufficiently high mental transaction costs that causes the need (natural evolution) of a single currency standard: >Once one commodity starts to be favored, the optimal strategy is to move to that currency. So we have shown that sufficiently high mental transaction costs are sufficient to cause the emergence of a currency standard, even in the absence of storage and transport costs. He gives greater detail and relevant explanation but here is the key point: >...with sufficiently low mental transaction costs and sufficiently unpredictable exchange rates, it pays to hang on to multiple currencies, and a world of multiple currencies is the equilibrium Interestingly: >At the extreme of zero mental transaction costs, zero storage costs, and zero transport costs, we have a pure barter market, with no need for money at all. The finale comes here when explains the birth of his market translator. The market translator is a technology beyond ethereum: >After good proxy measures have been developed, one must obtain or estimate user preferences in terms of these measures. Obtaining preferences directly from the user has to be done in with traditional value granularites, otherwise mental transaction costs dominate. Alternatively, further proxy measures can be made that estimate user economic preferences from their normal input behavior. These are then compiled into automated nanotransactions with the market translator. So there is good reasoning behind the different societal advances that necessitate either a single currency standard or multiple currencies being relevant.\n",
      "\"I apologize i have not shown up for the community until now. I designed the platform in 2007 that Sotoshi built for me in 2008 and now for you. This platform needs to get through consensus for a final decision on applying a scalible code. I prefer a 4mb to 8mb scale. It can scale only so high. Also mr. Ito is right and wrong. Sotoshi and i picked Gaven to run the platform and to follow our well thought out theory of rules. Those rules must be followed today! Without our Vision, bitcoin means nothing. Therefore rules are rules followed by a select group of core developers. Developers watch each other by distrust to complete the task. I am hearing that core is working for big $$ complanies to push their agenda. That would be a conflict of interest. Must stay true to the platform first and formost. If those companies are pushing too hard for scalability too fast. Drop them as they are not supposed to have ANY control period. REMEMBER! BITCOIN IS STILL JUST A EXPERIMENT! Sotoshi and I and core have backdoor keys if Bitcoin needs to be--shut off, completely. We will see our vision through as we theorized it to work towards great innovation. Core developers have to agree with each other to implement code. The other communities work to build the code, and vote for a final decision on changes to be made to the platform. 75% vote. I picked 75% for the rules and that is the way it is This platform has to stay peer to peer sharing, or our vision is lost and so is Bitcoin. Let me make this clear- Bitcoin is run alongside the Dollar. It is not to take over the dollar. If the dollar fails, bitcoin is to prop up a economy until agreements are made to print more tangible dollars. Sotoshi and i agreed that tangible U.S. Dollars must be kept in circulation. Do not out the dollar for a cashless society or Bitcoin is dead too and will turn corrupt too just like fiat. The whole community and developers must follow Sotoshi protocols.

I just wanted something simple and casual that reminded me every time I made a transaction that I was putting away a little bit of bitcoin. Even better is I have a lot of \"non-financial\" friends who have asked many times for the simplest method to get some bitcoin into savings without having to think about it. Ive always recommended lawnmower and the concept immediately strikes them. I guess its the developers choice and maybe they are doing better with this change. But it just sucks because I always found it really valuable as it was. I had even hoped future updates would further simplify it, rather than make it into another Coinbase app with different colors. Wondering what others thoughts on the change was? \n",

      "Last December the media again set itself aflame with claims of an \"unmasking\" of Bitcoins creator. As in prior events, the claims turned out to be untrue-- this time with the target seemingly having implicated himself with poorly backdated vague blog posts in order to advance a massive tax rebate fraud against the Australian Government. After the journalists exited stage left, heads hung in shame (but, presumably, wallets fat with the largess of countless page-views) and the Aussie authorities moved in to settle accounts in the rebate fraud, most here likely expected that would be the last we would hear of Craig Wright. Sadly, it doesnt look like it. During the last few months Craig and his accomplices have been very active quietly networking in the Bitcoin industry. Their pitch: Craig is the real thing and the press got it wrong. Their elaboration on the details would lower your IQ to hear it, so I wont bore you with it-- needless to say, few who are thinking critically and understand the technology would believe it and thats probably the point: its a filter. If you do listen long enough you find out that Craig, earnest creator of Bitcoin, and true heir to a MILLION BTC apparently has some procedural issues with a trust securing his funds, which could all be resolved with a bit of money-- but unfortunately, the evil dictators controlling his country have frozen all of his money... and thats where you come in dear reader. You see, he just needs a bit of money to complete the paperwork to obtain the coins, and-- of course-- secure safe passage to freeer lands... Thats right-- It sounds like hes setting up a classic [advanced fee fraud]( Now before you think that no one would be foolish enough to fall for this, keep in mind that these scams play on ego, vanity, greed (or better-- desperation)... You, Captain of Bitcoin Industry (or intrepid journalist) are being taken in Confidence by the mysterious Creator of Bitcoin-- inconsistencies in his story are to be expected, after all, mysterious is part of the job description!-- he happens to share all your views and concerns on Bitcoin, considers your own efforts important, and now he just needs some modest funding, and in return he eagerly wishes to invest in your (now starving for investment) Bitcoin Venture. You deserve a break and HE is putting his trust in you because you are very important and trustworthy. Of course, for security reasons-- and not to mention the unlawful flight from authorities-- you must keep this all completely confidential. (And especially dont discuss it with someone that might talk some sense into you!) Laid out like this it sounds stupid, but people-- including some \"big names\" (if not ones respected in this subreddit) appear to have fallen for it. The important thing is, you dont have to join their ranks. The pool of the best targets-- the ones with the easiest egos to stroke and the greatest access to funding-- is running dry and Craig is apparently taking his act on the road, metaphorically, to reach a wider audience. If someone approaches you, pause to apply some judgement. Think: if you were to read about someone else believing the story youre being told, how foolish would you think they are? As for those whove already been taken: Youre not the first person to get ripped off in the land of Bitcoin or through advanced fee fraud. Cut your losses and try to avoid embarrassing all of us. \n",
      "Hello, /r/bitcoin, I have received a transaction where the sender forgot to add a fee: I was sent 0.7 BTC, this is my receiving address: This was the senders first time using Bitcoin, and they are inexperienced about Bitcoin, so it is impossible to ask them to do any technical things and / or to resend the transaction. I decided that my best hope to get the transaction confirmed, was to spend the unconfirmed transaction to myself, and add a large fee (child-pays-for-parent). I did these steps: 1. Sent 0.005 BTC to my receiving address (14ZiRUCwzNfqmvgozQJCsSXHmPtHnABuX4) from another address. I did this so there would be enough bitcoins in my receiving address for the fees. 2. Manually constructed a transaction combining the no-fee (0.7 BTC) transaction and the 0.005 BTC transaction, and sent 0.7025 to another address, leaving 0.0025 BTC as a fee: 3. Manually pushed both transactions to the network (first the \"no-fee\" tx, then the \"0.0025 fee\" tx), using Bitcoin Core console and all services listed here: Was this the best approach to take? Is there anything else I can do to help the no-fee transaction get confirmed? So far it seems that my method did not work (both transactions are still unconfirmed). P.S. Using throwaway account for privacy.\n",
      "IAM REALLY NEW TO BITCOIN So, i just loaded up my Virwox Account with 10 Euro via PayPal. Then i transformed that Money into SLL and the SLL Money into Bitcoins (0.0200000). After that i went to my MultiBit HD Wallet, clicked request, copied my adress from that little window and inserted it to the selection \"pay out\" at virwox. Because I have a new account, the transaction to my MultiBit Account will take 48hours and i will get a confirmation email, what is no problem. But iam not sure about \"my\" adress I used, was it right like I did it? Oh, and another question: I want to send the Bitcoins to someone of course, but when i click send in my MultiBit wallet and tip in 0.02, it says that thats like 0.01 dollar, so I guess that it will be another currency when the bitcoins come to my MultiBit account. How much will my 0.02 Bitcoins from Virwox be ? And can I send it from MultiBit to any other website without any problem?

      "I think I understand how mining works. I have a tech background, but Cryptocurrency mining is such a novel concept, Ive been chewing on an analogy that best relates. Heres what Ive come up with, I appreciate feedback to dial it. ---- Bitcoin is won in a sort of lottery. It isnt an ordinary lottery ticket, its a puzzle lotto. Filling out the ticket requires solving the problem on the ticket. These problems are invented by the BTC International Accounting Department, whose job is to audit every expense made with BTC, theyve cleverly found a way to use lotto players to help them Audit. The BTCIAD puzzle division only has so many prizes to give out, so it had to make the puzzles harder to slow the number winners. The puzzles are so complicated that a computer is required to play. When it started out, it used to be any computer could solve these puzzles pretty quickly. Someone discovered that Gaming computers were even faster at solving the puzzles, so more entries could be put in. Then somebody then created a puzzle solving super robot in this great puzzle solving arms race. Its reached a point where there are factories of puzzle solving super robots that makes it tough for people to play anymore. ----- Or maybe it makes more sense: ----- Bitcoin is a prize of a great safecracking game. In order to open the safes, you need to decode the great \"Accounting Ledger\" found in the BLOCK. It started out as only a handful of amateur safecrackers, but there ended up with more safes, and harder combinations. To the point of requiring teams of master burglars in order to find the prize. Maybe someone else has a better analogy?\n",

I am in the process of doing research on both the promise/potential-issues of digital currencies/blockchain and need some information from those with more knowledge on the issue than myself. I know blockchain technology years from being fully realized, so my questions are all \"theoretically\" and \"hypothetically\". 1. In order for sanctions to be effective, they often require huge cooperation with the global financial banking system. Blockchain in many respects, uproots the middle-man that is banks. Could a rouge state theoretically create a private blockchain, or use a public one, to circumvent banks all together and thus avoid sanctions? 2. I have heard/read from various sources that the government is consdering requiring blockchains to be coded with AML (anti-money laundering) code. Would anyone care to explain how this would work? Developer push back aside, is this plausible? Anyway, thanks in advance for your help. This is an incredibly important issue and in order to make sure government doesnt ruin the massive potential that is blockchain, it is better to get out in front of these questions rather than have gov be taken by surprise.\n",

      "If we take the number of transactions excluding chains longer than 10 as a good measure for \"normal\" transactions ( we find there are about 70,000 transactions per day. If a wallet paid someone 1 btc in one transaction output and they then transferred that to cold storage the same day that would be a chain of two. So a chain of 10 is already suspicious. A \"normal\" transaction with 2 inputs and 2 outputs is 374 bytes. Bitcoin can do 1,000,000/374 x 6 x 24 = 385,000 of those per day.

No one really knows who they are anymore and have seen very little publicity in terms of conference speeches etc. Compare this to Gavin Andresen who was very open in discussing ideas and very public in his appearances. He also had the trust of satoshi which did wonders for confidence in his abilities. The current core devs have the opposite.

A lot of people became optimistic... And today several things happened:  price went back to $415, with a week-high volume on bitfinex (massive dump)  people are reporting that a spam attack is back:  we see [blocks are full]( posts again; skeptical comments are massively downvoted More about spam attack, as you can see [here]( for the last week there was no \"fee market\", many transactions paying only 5000 satoshi per kilobyte were confirmed (red line on the upper graph). Then suddenly mempool size shoots up... So... is it just a coincidence, or is there a coordinated effort to keep Bitcoin price artificially low? This idea was formulated before, but today I was able to see it having a predictive power, so to speak: I checked Bitcoin price today only after I saw \"blocks are full\" article on reddit, and my prediction that massive dump is coming was right. Of course, this could be just a coincidence. Or there might be a different causal relationship, e.g. theres elevated traffic _due to_ a dump on exchanges. But these alternative explanations do not look plausible, as both spam and dump are intentional rather than random.

      "Title:An alpaca to the moon Technique: acrylic on canvas Dimensions: 150 x 100 cm (When you imagine bitcoin you just visualize an uppercase B with two lines going through it, but from an artistic and iconographic point of view theres much more that should be investigated! the philosophy, the anecdotes, the community behind bitcoin is what make this network so powerful. I am trying to describe it from an artistic point of view) In 2011 a post on Slashdot described various goods and services could be purchased with bitcoins, among which Grass Hill Alpacas, that sold alpaca socks for bitcoin. In march 2011 the most-widely known video that introduces bitcoin (What is Bitcoin? check it on youtube) uses an alpaca as a mascotte and described alpaca socks as one of the products bitcoin could buy. \"To the moon\" is a sencence used by bitcoiners whenever the cryptocurrency is “going to the moon,” or set to raise in price dramatically. In order to describe in an artistic way these concepts behind bitcoin, I made this painting. Hope you like it! \n",

      "Sorry for the provocative title but maybe some PR guy @ kraken will end up noticing it and finally take care of my issue ... I recently registered on kraken.com and filled up their questionaire to get verified. I then wired them around 300 € from my bank account hoping I would be able to start trading some ETH the next day or so ... Right after ending the transaction I noticed I had sent them USD instead of euros so I contacted their support to make sure they had received the money. A couple of days later I received an automated email answer telling me that they were so busy with their new acquisitions and migrations that support questions could take up to a week before being answered ... my transfer has been made on the 17th of march ... we are the 29th ... I already tried to recontact support a couple of times with absolutely no answer from them. So basically what do you think ? Can I kiss my 300 buck goodbye ? Heck I sure wouldnt want to have to take this guys route to recover my money : But if I have to ... I just might :) Thanks for sharing your thoughts. \n",

      "Hello, like many others I had my coinbase limits drastically decreased for no stated reason ($2.5k daily to $100), and Im interested in restoring them. In all likelihood they were capped because I had purchased a significant quantity of coins and withdrew them to my local wallet. Understandably coinbase has its own liabilities and cant let customers move large funds in and out willy-nilly. Now their support sends me vague and generic responses suggesting I proceed with further verification to restore my limits. So my question is, will this actually work? Does anyone have experience with this situation and have been able to restore their old limits (not just a marginal increase), either through verification or other means? Just looking for feedback before I turn over even more personal information to them. Specifically my options are to submit a photo ID, or proceed with \"level 3\". Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. For the record Im aware of alternatives like circle and localbitcoins, and would prefer to purchase through coinbase for now.\n",

      "First of all, I should note its not a big deal and there are no reasons to panic or anything, but its just remarkable that the thing we knew is theoretically possible is happening now. To provide background on this kind of attack I need to start from fundamentals. Heres the security assumption from the Bitcoin paper: > The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes. Originally mining was done by users themselves, it was a part of node/wallet software. However, later it became more specialized. Hashing, running nodes and using Bitcoin are completely separate things nowadays when pooled mining is commonplace. That is, somebody can \"mine\" bitcoins using his hashing hardware without running a node. (And, perhaps, without even being a Bitcoin user, as a \"miner\" can auto-convert his revenue to dollars.) Calling this \"mining\" isnt quite accurate. More precisely it can be described as renting (that is, mining pools rent hashing hardware of so-called \"miners\") or paying for a service (mining pools pays a \"miner\" for the efforts hes performed). Some \"miners\" believe that they receive bitcoins they created, but its not true in a general case. One thing is that more often then not, individual miners fail to solve the block, but are still compensated for their efforts (not for results). Also pools generally have reserves which they use to smooth out reward payments, thus rewards miners receive do not necessarily come from freshly mined bitcoins. Now lets recall that hashpower is intimately linked to the security of the network. Attacker who controls a significant portion of total hashpower might be able to perform double-spend attacks (e.g. see Meni Rosenfelds [Analysis of Hashrate-Based Double Spending]( or denial-of-service attacks (he might mine empty blocks). It is usually understood that these attacks are practically unfeasible, as overpowering the honest network would require enormous amounts of hardware, energy, etc. However, there are several different attack model. The most primitive one was relevant back when mining was done on CPUs: an attacker could rent CPU power from a cloud provider such as Amazon and try to do a double-spend reorganization or a 51% attack. Its fairly easy to do calculations within this model as the cost of an attack is known (for a certain difficulty) and one just needs to compare it to potential profits attacker might get. But CPU mining is irrelevant now, attacker would need specialized hardware to have a chance. This makes attack much more complex, as attacker needs to buy hardware, deploy it, start mining... And once attack is complete, he needs to do something with that hardware. Its generally understood that parties who own hashing hardware will be reluctant to perform attack because a successful attack can drastically decrease the value of the hardware they own. Thus it can be said that ASICs made Bitcoin much more secure due to this stickiness. But wait... what if an attacker rents hardware instead of buying it? Its much simpler than buying hardware: no complex logistics, little overhead, no concerns about how an attack would affect hardware price. Attacker would need to pay slightly above the market price to make sure he gets more than a half of total hashpower to make sure that its statistically certain his attack can succeed. This can be describe as a sort of a bribe. Normally miners get block rewards (subsidy + fees). Attacker adds a bribe to it, making it `subsidy + fees + bribe`. This is attractive to miners as it pays more. Once attack is successful, attacker receives `subsidy + fees + attack profit`. Thus his cost is (subsidy + fees + attack profit) - (subsidy + fees + bribe) = attack profit - bribe Note that `bribe` can be arbitrarily small, it should be just enough to get miners interested. It can be 1% of a subsidy, for example. E.g. suppose attacker wants to earn 1000 BTC by double-spending, he gives a 10 BTC bribe to miners to orphan some of the recent blocks and pockets 990 BTC. The cost of this attack can be arbitrarily small, but it requires a lot of a capital and is also quite risky. And also its not possible right now because miners do not just rent their hashpower to the highest bidder, they use mining pools they trust. Thus theres no way for the attacker go get more than 50% of total hashpower to be successful with this attack. There are, however, pools which allow people to rent hashpower. For example, [NiceHash]( It currently has 16 PH/s of SHA256 hashpower (according to the stats they publish), thus controlling around 1% of total hashpower. NiceHash allocates hashpower to highest bidder, and thus it can be potentially used for attacks I described above. But currently its too small to have any effect. So this is just something to keep in mind. Pools like NiceHash are evil, they can potentially destabilize Bitcoin if more than a half of total Bitcoins hashpower will be rented out on pools like this. It is important for miners to choose legitimate pools. So until now I thought that a bribe attack is just a curiosity in context of Bitcoin (it might be more relevant for alt-coins with much weaker hashpower), but today I was surprised with the fact that somebody tries to pull it off right now. Theres a post on /r/btc: [Someone just donated 16 BTC towards Classic Hashpower. We are now at 2 Petahash/sec on Slush pool. Thank you, donator. The fund is at 30 BTC and recycling the mining rewards over and over.]( This is exactly the bribe attack, but they arent using for double-spending or DoS, but on an attempt to hard-fork Bitcoin. Basically its an attempt to artificially prop up Classic hashpower a little, and is good only for PR. But still its something we should be aware of, I think. NodeCounter site the link points to is absolutely hilarious, BTW, totally recommend: > Bitcoin development has been bought out by a private company called \"Blockstream\". > Blockstream has directed the crippling of Bitcoin in order to provide the solution, for their own future, financial gain. (I hope moderators wont remove my post. /r/btc is currently being advertised in the sidebar of this subreddit, so every visitor is already one click away from learning information about \"Classic Hashpower\". I see absolutely no point in censoring this information.) On topic of brigading: when I posted it initially the post was 100% upvoted, that is regular /r/bitcoin subscribers found it good and relevant. However a bit later upvote rate dropped to 65% and at the same time several comments defending Classic and /r/btc appeared. Brigading much? I dont really care what you do with hashpower (attack is just a technical term FYI, its not necessarily morally wrong), but brigading is despicable. \n",

      "Blockchain Technology in Europe: Theory and Practice On May 19, Prague will host Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference Prague. The event will bring together blockchain developers and those who apply the technology in practice: financiers, bankers and businessmen. The event will consist of a conference, divided into two streams, and an exhibition of IT developments in the field of Blockchain. The participants will talk about the practical application of Blockchain technology and its legislative regulation in Europe. Developers of payment services and gadgets will deliver their reports. Guests of the conference will learn how to protect your personal data and avoid becoming victims of cybercrime, as well as what you need to know about the legal requirements in respect of Blockchain. What is interesting about this technology? Blockchain is a chain of transactions in the Bitcoin system, which accelerates transactions and protects them from external interference. In addition, developers have realized that it can help transfer not only money, but also any data. It makes it easy to obtain certificates from state agencies and makes the taxation system transparent: every taxpayer knows where his/her money goes. The technology has been already used in practice: in Europe, there are applications that allow you to make purchases and take gadgets to maintenance service. IT-enthusiasts use it in the field of Internet of Things. The first results will be presented in the framework of the demo area at the event. Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference Prague is an event for not only IT specialists, financiers and investors. The Organizer, Smile-Expo Company, is glad to see everyone who is interested in the development of new technologies, which in 5 years will become as popular as the Internet and smart phones are today.
