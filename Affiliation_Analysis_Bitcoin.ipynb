Since Cryptsy\\'s liabilities are primarily in Bitcoin it is theorized he is likely still working closely with them to come up with a way to resolve their problems. Big Verne has [flown to China](https://archive.is/azdHg) and is likely working closely with Marshall Long in order to create a hard fork where the coins from the losing chain can be dumped on Cryptsy\\'s users for pennies on the dollar.\\n\\nThe smoking gun here is how he all of a sudden goes from supporting the core roadmap and [saying miners nearly unanimously support segwit](https://archive.is/WiIu7) on Dec 14th to a complete about face and [withdraw of his support from the roadmap on Jan 5th](https://archive.is/Gux3Z) do a search for \"FinalHash\" in those archive links to see the specific posts in question. Shortly after this about face it is [revealed](https://archive.is/MGDD6) that Cryptsy was running a fractional reserve. Cryptsy likely knew about [pending legal action](https://archive.is/94oLl) back in December and would be working on a strategy to resolve their liabilities. Dumping pre-fork coins on their users is a plausible strategy for resolving their legal liabilities.\\n\\nThe people involved with Bitcoin Classic have close ties to FinalHash and Cryptsy and have been working under repository called \"Multicoin-co\" [here](https://archive.is/EddiM).\\n\\nYou can see details of the Bitcoin Classic involvement in FinalHash [lead developer](https://archive.is/fRJ2h) Ahmed Bodiwala\\'s [github history](https://archive.is/nPmb2) who as you can see [here](https://archive.is/uVYw4) has been very active with altcoin development and also has close ties to Cryptsy in addition to having commit access to the bitcoin classic repository along with jtoomim and Marshall Long himself. Marshall Long was also [closely involved](https://archive.is/aAT2C) with the [mintsy.co scam](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1165856.0). Marshall long has been involved in countless other scams such as GAW miners.\\n\\nWhile it is just a theory that Marshall Long is pushing for a hard fork to dump the losing chain\\'s coins on Cryptsy users it does seem like a realistic possibility given the evidence. Even if there is another reason for this hard fork push do you really want someone involved with all these scams to be in charge of bitcoin protocol development?',\n",

It should be a floating function based on demand for the utility that this global public good provides.\\n\\nMiners will naturally set their block size at a size that is convenient for them (getting the most amount of transaction fees by including the most transactions) whilst limiting themselves to their bandwidth and storage capabilities. \\n\\nIF bandwidth naturally limits blocksizes globally over the long term in the future, yet growth and demand continue, fees will rise.. that higher fee incentive will drive some smart people to find a way around the problem and those smart miners will grow their blocksizes to capture the fee reward, thus balancing the supply and demand equation and bringing fees back down.. mining the optimum blocksize will become an industry just as hash rate has become an industry.. do we limit the hash rate, no, so why should we limit the blocksize.\\n\\nThis will be done at the same time developers implement new and exciting features to increase bitcoins capacity like segwit. \\n\\nMiners creating an entire optimum blocksize industry, along with capacity increases from devs like segwit, In unison will make bitcoin an unchallengable open permissionless public good.\\n\\nEdit: censorship resistant features in core along with every miner switching to p2pool to reduce centralisation should answer any other concerns. (We need a single \\'everyone switch to p2pool day\\'.. worst case u loose a days profit, if it works mining centralisation probelms fixed). A.k.a. if every miner including the large pools all switched to p2pool, censorship would be impossible and centralisation impossible. meaning blocksize increases are a non issue, and we can have both blocks that grow with demand and as many layer 2 payment networks as we like. Heck, there may even be a way to make a core designated version of p2pool and enforce it as mandatory from a core level. If it helps the protocol grow it may be a good compromise. One single mandatory p2p mining pool in core.',\n",

       "  'It might be said that classic and alternative \"clients\" could be a benefit to the community simply because they are mobilizing scaling improvements faster than they otherwise would have been. Maybe Segregated witness would have been a slower process had there not been controversy. But maybe that also wouldn\\'t have been such a bad thing due to the idea that having rushed code could be bad. Or is that underestimating Pieter Wuille?\\n\\n>( from Sergio Lerner, prominent Bitcoin core dev) from BitcoinClassic Slack Channel:\\nsergiodemianlerner 5:29 PM Regarding SegWit, I don\\'t know if you have actually looked at the code but the amount of code changed, including consensus code, is huge. (maybe ~500 lines). I think such change has never been attempted in the history of Bitcoin. We cannot just say lightly that a couple of weeks after the 2mb hard-fork we\\'re going to deploy segwit. That code needs months of review. Also I\\'m against the complexity of segwit as a soft-fork (probably requires 200 additional lines of code of consensus critical code). Segwit almost prevents consensus-compatible re-implementations of Bitcoin in other languages.\\n\\nIf the community and miners can\\'t fork from a developer team, then all it would take to control and take over bitcoin is the ability to control a select group of people with commit access.\\n\\nThere is the possibility in the near future that an artificial fee market develops and a severe backlog of transactions happens. When that occurs, transactions will be pushed off the network. Maybe they are spam transactions. Maybe they are transactions that go to another place such as paypal or another coin. When there is a severe backlog of transactions you have the problem of unreliability. When does your transaction confirm? Maybe it\\'s 1 hour. Maybe it is 5, using your wallets best guess. That\\'s probably the point of opt-in RBF... so you aren\\'t stuck.(There are some reports of businesses using the network already experiencing these kind of problems and we aren\\'t even in the severe backlog days)\\n\\nThe classic team is (for the better part of my knowledge) releasing code at the end of January where it will be in review for 2-4 weeks and then deployed where the activation happens 2-4 weeks after that. So You could have a double in transaction capacity by sometime in March.\\n\\nSegregated witness on the other hand has gone live on the test net. Some estimates say that once it is deployed (I heard April, but maybe sooner?), that its deployment will take a year afterward for all the software required to use it. If it is fully 100% deployed and everyone uses it then it will give us an effective capacity of 1.75MB (Still less than the hard fork option).\\n\\nThe point is that if the network has the capacity now to do something it should take the better short term can kick. It makes more sense to slow Segregated witness down. Test it more, and think about doing it as a hard fork instead of a soft fork. Sure, SW has other benefits besides increased transaction capacity. Like fixing malleability. But in the short term, not kicking off some people who transact with bitcoin, not scaring future investors because of how \"inflexible\" bitcoin is and not stalling growth is a smarter move. There have been many people lately who have warned about this. Stalling growth, premature optimization... things like this can have effects that can result in slower growth and increasing popularity of alternatives. \\n\\nLastly, there is that issue of hard forks. I hear a lot of people defending the core developers and saying that they plan to hard fork after segregated witness at some point. The argument against hard forks gets stronger over time. If they won\\'t do it now when there are people clamoring for it then why would they ever do it?  Keep in mind that soft forks are just as powerful as hard forks and that they could in the future hack a solution using something called \"extension blocks\" to keep the network going.\\n\\non an interesting note according to maaku7: \\n\\n>It will activate probably weeks after it is deployed, and the second question is irrelevant. It does not matter how many people have upgraded for you to experience the benefit of segwit. If you have a client generating segwit transactions they will be counted as about half as big regardless of how many other people have upgraded.\\n\\nThat means people who use upgraded wallets will immediately be able to get the benefits of SW. That might hasten deployment faster than some think. But it also probably means people with hardware wallets and less informed users are SoL.\\n\\nIt might be that eventually bitcoin cannot scale past a certain point of growth, and that some kind of backlog of fees will be inevitable. But lets not rush that. Lets instead do the simpler solutions that we know work and prepare the more complex solutions in the meantime.',\n",

Companies building on blockchain technology!

My argument is that by not increasing the block size (allowing full blocks / dropped transactions / high fee transactions) you destroy many startups using bitcoin in the process and they are the ones hosting many full nodes already, so by not raising the block size you wil actually **reduce** full nodes and **increase** centralisation!\\n\\nPlease explain to me how discouraging other platforms to build ontop of bitcoin therefore no longer hosting a full node is beneficial. \\n\\nExample, Factom. A platform that hashes data into the bitcoin blockchain for security. If there is no blockchain transaction capacity increase, they will have no choice but to move their entire business model onto the next most secure blockchain just to operate with reliability, taking their full nodes with them.

And most recently, Core\\'s post [here](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/) was very helpful - well-written and informative. \\n\\nA sincere thank you to Core for demonstrating improvement in this area. Keep it up.\\n\\nUpon this momentum, may I now offer the following humble suggestion: **with two more moves, Core can end the civil war.** \\n\\nThis suggestion is based on discussions with various parties over the past two weeks. Anything less than both is unlikely to settle the issue in any meaningful way. That suggestions are being given to Core, as opposed to Core\\'s opponents, is not an indication that Core is \"primarily at fault\" or that it\\'s Core\\'s sole responsibility to fix things. Rather, it is because Core has the power and position to effect meaningful change, in my opinion.\\n\\n**Move 1)** Core clearly commits to a hard fork block size increase, by adding it to its formal roadmap.  The specific plan should probably be the 2-4-8 plan, as proposed initially by [Adam Back](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/636410827969421312), and which achieved widespread consensus after the scaling conferences. The time to add it to the roadmap is now, and the time to execute the HF should then, within reason, be up to Core\\'s stewardship. This needn\\'t interfere with, and is certainly not a replacement for, the much beloved SegWit.\\n\\n**Move 2)** Core formally, publicly, and clearly denounces the censorship that has plagued community discussion, and should apologize for not having done so earlier. Core is not responsible for the censorship, but stood silently by as it happened, allowing widespread mistrust to grow out of control.\\n\\nIf Core can gather the consensus among its members to take these two steps, and can do so with professionalism, humility, and a sincere desire to move forward and help the community heal, then I believe it will. \\n\\nThis would be a victory for the major factions of this divisive issue. We could then all get back to building. There are so many battles ahead to fight against the real enemy. This one, against each other, needs to end.\\n\\nAnd please, above all, civility in these discussions is paramount.  To Core - thank you for the work you have done, and continue to do.

       "  'The topic of how SPV mining is bad has come up several times in the last year. There was a [recent proposal](http://trilema.com/2016/the-necessary-prerequisite-for-any-change-to-the-bitcoin-protocol/) to demand that miners prove that they have received all of the contents of a block before they can start mining. There have been various proposals in the same spirit over the years.\\n\\nI think making miners prove they have the full contents of the block they are trying to build on is a bad idea, because it puts miners at a disadvantage if they cannot rapidly acquire the entire block contents. This task favors centralized players with high bandwidth, low latency connectivity, which is expensive, and the problem gets worse the larger blocks get. Players with poor connectivity will fail to mine profitably because too much of their time will be spent receiving and validating each block.\\n\\nA similar benefit could be achieved without the negative centralization impact if the miners are asked to provide evidence that they validated a block far enough in the past. For example, if miners were required to provide evidence that they validated a block at height H - 4 when mining the block at height H, then you have a situation where there is a 99.9% chance that the block at H - 4 will have been broadcast more than 250 seconds ago. On average, miners would have 30 minutes to receive and validate the H - 4 block.\\n\\nI do not know exactly what kind of evidence the miners should be asked to provide. It would be nice if the evidence had the following properties:\\n\\n1. Showed that they actually validated the block, not just that they knew it. Alternatively, it could maybe just take a similar amount of time as validation takes, so that there is no temporal cost to validating in parallel.\\n\\n2. Verifying the evidence would not add much time to the overall block validation step.\\n\\n3. Verifying the evidence would not be necessary to perform the rest of the block validation. Like with segwit, nodes could skip this verification if they wanted to.\\n\\n4. Was hard to outsource. For example, perhaps the proof could incorporate the header from block H-1, or some of the intermediate mining steps that would only be accessible to someone who was about to solve the block.\\n\\nThe above idea could be implemented with a soft fork, and would create incentives that would practically guarantee that miners would would validate every block as soon as possible.\\n\\nIt would not absolutely enforce that behavior, so theoretically miners could construct a chain 3 blocks long on top of an invalid block before they were forced to prove knowledge of the bad block. I think this would be incredibly unlikely if the above idea were implemented because the cost to behave \"properly\" would be negligible, and if you misbehave you risk losing a lot of money.\\n\\nBut what if such a chain were produced?\\n\\nFirst of all, unless the network is deploying a soft fork, fully validating nodes would not accept the bad block and would not notice the bad chain. As I understand it, the fact that SPV nodes do not validate blocks could cause them to follow this bad chain, however this vulnerability could be improved with a simple fix. When validating nodes serve blocks to SPV nodes, they would include a message to indicate that they have personally validated the block. SPV nodes could be configured to consider a block \"provisional\" until several nodes indicate that they have validated the block.\\n\\n***\\n\\nMy first reaction to this issue was that SPV mining did not present a big problem because miners are incentivized to validate as soon as possible, and discard blocks or chains when they discovered they were invalid. I have changed my mind this weekend and suggest making the changes described above. What I realized, is that while SPV mining is pretty harmless during normal operation, it can be disastrous during a soft fork.\\n\\nConsider this scenario:\\n\\n1. A soft fork is being rolled out, and whatever threshold of miners has been reached. Blocks that do not conform to the soft fork are officially considered invalid.\\n\\n2. An un-upgraded miner produces a block that is valid according to the old rules, but invalid according to the new rules.\\n\\n3. Even though they indicated that they were ready for the soft fork, a large fraction of the miners are just SPV mining, not actually validating. They do not notice that this block does not obey the rules of the soft fork and they build on it. Call this chain B for bad.\\n\\n4. Un-upgraded nodes cannot notice that these blocks are \"bad.\" They see these blocks as confirming transactions.\\n\\n5. Miners who have upgraded, and are validating, reject the longest chain and continue working on the soft fork. Call this chain G for good.\\n\\n6. Upgraded nodes follow chain G.\\n\\n7. The network therefore experiences an unplanned hard fork between chain B and chain G. Eventually all miners will switch to one of the two chains, but it cannot be known ahead of time which chain will win. This is pretty much a worst case scenario.\\n\\nFrom the above, part of the personality of a soft-fork becomes more clear to me. During a soft fork, it is impossible for fully validating nodes, if they are not upgraded, to determine whether or not they are on the correct chain. This puts almost all of the power and responsibility on the miners. If they mine without validating during this delicate phase, no one else is positioned well to correct their mistakes. Un-upgraded nodes are effectively turned into SPV clients -- not just for transactions making use of newly rolled out features, but for the question of which chain is valid.\\n\\nIdeally, miners would:\\n\\n1. Receive the solved header for H - 1\\n\\n2. Start mining H with no transactions\\n\\n3. Receive a compact message that allows them to include at least some transactions while mining H.\\n\\n4. Receive the main block H - 1 absent the SW and do a complete (provisional) update of the UTXO state. Prioritize transactions and start mining a full block.\\n\\n5. Receive the segregated witness for H -1 and fully validate the block.\\n\\n6. Discard the current block and roll back the utxo state if you have discovered that H - 1 is invalid.\\n\\nForcing miners to validate prior to hashing could cause most miners to **stop validating at all** and outsource the validation job to specialists with low latency internet connections, much like how high frequency trading is done on computers that are physically located close together. This is not a good idea.\\n\\nWhy is introducing anything that allows miners to \"make progress\" toward solving a block a deadly sin, but this proposal, which allows certain miners (especially the one who solved the last block and already has it and knows that it is valid) to get a head start is a-ok?',\n",

I joined /r/btc, installed bitcoin unlimited and later Bitcoin Classic and felt good about it.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nMy reasoning was very simple:\\n\\n1) My transactions got stuck from time to time and I got annoyed waiting for confirmations.\\xa0\\n\\n2) I believed that just increasing the blocksize would solve the issue, everyone can handle 2MB right?\\xa0\\n\\n3) I didn\\'t like the fact that a lot of Core devs were all working for the same company (Blockstream) and  at that point I believed the goal of Blockstream was to create a LN with paid subscription, which was mentioned a lot of times on /r/btc. Trying to force the average user off the blockchain.\\xa0\\n\\n4) I didn\\'t like the moderation on /r/bitcoin.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n**What I\\'ve come to realize in the last week:** \\xa0\\n\\n1) After reading the arguments by Peter Todd and other core devs in regards of the scaling it makes sense. You can\\'t keep increasing the blocksize, it\\'s the wrong approach. Bitcoin by itself will never be able to handle the amount of transactions Visa can.\\xa0\\n\\n2) I like the fact that the Core team took the time to have a meeting with the big miners and some other big players in the market to come up with a consensus that neither side is happy with but both can live with. (that shows that it\\'s a real consensus and not someone bullying the other one in a bad agreement)\\xa0\\n\\n3) If you try to read /r/btc it\\'s always the same, excuse my French, circlejerk. Always boiling down to the same issues they have with Core and Blockstream, instead of trying to focus on something positive. After reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/47e8ec/one_of_the_many_reasons_bitcoin_insiders_are/) about one of the main guys behind Classic, I started to have a bad feeling about it.\\xa0\\n\\n4) /r/btc tries to take pride in the fact that there is no real censorship, try to make 1 post where you something remotely positive about Core (not even related to the issues with Classic) and you\\'ll get downvoted to oblivion, it\\'s just another type of censorship.\\xa0\\n\\n5) The fact that one of the Blockstream employees, Mark Friedenbach, didn\\'t like the consensus and was open about it, showed to me at least that there is more going on than just Blockstream trying to push their agenda and that they do have, for now, Bitcoins best interest in mind.\\xa0\\n\\n6) There is still room to grow if we can fill those empty blocks being mined and Antpool that only fills to 730kb, that should be more than enough until segwit comes out.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n**Other reasons why I switched back:** \\xa0\\n\\n1) Core has a lot more combined programming experience than Classic, I\\'d rather have a team that has the experience since they will see most potential issues from miles away. Note: Gavin is not an active programmer anymore and so he has nothing to do with Classic code.\\xa0\\n\\n2) Some wallets will immediately implement Segwit as soon as it\\'s in production and anyone aware of this will use it to get in the next block. I see a lot of people immediately using this which will decrease the mempool.\\xa0\\n\\n3) 1 year is long, I admit, but if you\\'ve ever been involved in a complicated software project you know that you need enough time to test and prepare all the clients, make everyone upgrade. There will always be nodes that \"forget\" or just don\\'t upgrade.\\xa0\\n\\n4) Just increasing the blocksize doesn\\'t work, you need an alternative, LN is the only real realistic solution I see. I don\\'t see 16 MB blocks happening.\\xa0\\n\\n5) The Classic community is really small actually, but very vocal and negative. Just check the posts on their page, either extremely negative, trying to find some words they can twist from someone to make it seems they are evil, or the other posts are just that they mined a couple of blocks with a very limited amount of support.\\xa0\\n\\n6) The Vocal leaders of Classic Olivier, Brian, Marshall, Roger, either don\\'t have any coding experience, don\\'t understand the impact or they are just not people I want to associate with.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n**TLDR; I\\'d rather be in a positive community and I believe that the roadmap proposed during the roundtable is the way to go forward.**',\n",

Are you in a Cold War? Your evaluation on BS was pretty high “If this amazing team offers you a job, you should take it,” tweeted Gavin Andresen, Chief Scientist, Bitcoin Foundation.”  But now, what’s your opinion on BS?\\n\\n> **A:** I think everybody at Blockstream wants Bitcoin to succeed, and I respect and appreciate great work being done for Bitcoin by people at Blockstream.\\n\\n> We strongly disagree on priorities and timing; I think the risks of increasing the block size limit right away are very small. I see evidence of people and businesses getting frustrated by the limit and choosing to use something else (like Ethereum or a private blockchain); it is impossible to know for certain how dangerous that is for Bitcoin, but I believe it is more danger than the very small risk of simply increasing or eliminating the block size limit.\\n\\n**2. Ma_Ya**\\n\\n> **Q: 1)** Why insist on hard fork at only 75%? You once explained that it is possible to be controlled by 5% if we set the threshold at 95%. I agree, but there should be some balance here. 75% means a high risk in splitting, isn’t it too aggressive? Is it better if we set it to 90%?\\n\\n> **A: 1)**The experience of the last two consensus changes is that miners very quickly switch once consensus reaches 75% -- the last soft fork went from 75% support to well over 95% support in less than one week. So I’m very confident that miners will all upgrade once the 75% threshold is reached, and BIP109 gives them 28 days to do so. No miner wants to create blocks that will not be accepted by the network.\\n\\n> **Q: 2)** How to solve the potentially very large blocks problem Classic roadmap may cause, and furthur causing the centralization of nodes in the future?\\n\\n> **A: 2)**Andreas Antonopoulos gave a great talk recently about how people repeatedly predicted that the Internet would fail to scale. Smart engineers proved them wrong again and again, and are still busy proving them wrong today (which is why I enjoy streaming video over my internet connection just about every night).\\n\\n> I began my career working on 3D graphics software, and saw how quickly we went from being able to draw very simple scenes to today’s technology that is able to render hundreds of millions of triangles per second.\\n\\n> Processing financial transactions is much easier than simulating reality. Bitcoin can easily scale to handle thousands of transactions per second, even on existing computers and internet connections, and even without the software optimizations that are already planned.\\n\\n> **Q: 3)** Why do you not support the proposal of RBF by Satoshi, and even plan to remove it in Classic completely?\\n\\n> **A: 3)** Replace-by-fee should be supported by most of the wallets people are using before it is supported by the network. Implementing replace-by-fee is very hard for a wallet, especially multi-signature and hardware wallets that might not be connected to the network all of the time.\\n\\n> When lots of wallet developers start saying that replace-by-fee is a great idea, then supporting it at the network level makes sense. Not before.\\n\\n> **Q: 4)** . Your opinion on soft fork SegWit, sidechain, lighnting network. Are you for or against, please give brief reasons. Thanks.\\n\\n> **A: 4)** The best way to be successful is to let people try lots of different things. Many of them won’t be successful, but that is not a problem as long as some of them are successful.\\n\\n> I think segregated witness is a great idea. It would be a little bit simpler as a hard fork instead of a soft fork (it would be better to put the merkle root for the witness data into the merkle root in the block header instead of putting it inside a transaction), but overall the design is good.\\n\\n> I think sidechains are a good idea, but the main problem is finding a good way to keep them secure. I think the best uses of sidechains will be to publish “write-only” public information involving bitcoin. For example, I would like to see a Bitcoin exchange experiment with putting all bids and asks and trades on a sidechain that they secure themselves, so their customers can verify that their orders are being carried out faithfully and nobody at the exchanges is “front-running” them.\\n\\n> **Q: 5)**  Can you share your latest opinion on Brainwallet? It is hard for new users to use long and complex secure passphrase, but is it a good tool if it solves this problem?\\n\\n> **A: 5)** We are very, very bad at creating long and complex passphrases that are random enough to be secure. And we are very good at forgetting things.\\n\\n> We are much better at keeping physical items secure, so I am much more excited about hardware wallets and paper wallets than I am about brain wallets. I don’t trust myself to keep any bitcoin in a brain wallet, and do not recommend them for anybody else, either.\\n\\n**3. BiTeCui**\\n\\n> **Q:** Gavin, do you have bitcoins now? What is your major job in MIT? Has FBI ever investigated on you? When do you think SHA256 might be outdated, it seems like it has been a bit unsafe?\\n\\n> **A:** Yes, a majority of my own person wealth is still in bitcoins -- more than a financial advisor would say is wise.\\n\\n> My job at MIT is to make Bitcoin better, in whatever way I think best. That is the same major job I had at the Bitcoin Foundation. Sometimes I think the best way to make Bitcoin better is to write some code, sometimes to write a blog post about what I see happening in the Bitcoin world, and sometimes to travel and speak to people.\\n\\n> The FBI (or any other law enforcement agency) has never investigated me, as far as I know. The closest thing to an investigation was an afternoon I spent at the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, DC. They were interested in how I and the other Bitcoin developers created the software and how much control we have over whether or not people choose to run the software that we create.\\n\\n> “Safe or unsafe” is not the way to think about cryptographic algorithms like SHA256. They do not suddenly go from being 100% secure for everything to completely insecure for everything. I think SHA256 will be safe enough to use in the all ways that Bitcoin is using it for at least ten years, and will be good enough to be used as the proof-of-work algorithm forever.\\n\\n> It is much more likely that ECDSA, the signature algorithm Bitcoin is using today, will start to become less safe in the next ten or twenty years, but developer are already working on replacements (like Schnorr signatures).\\n\\n**4. SanPangHenBang** \\n\\n> **Q:** It’s a pleasure to meet you. I only have one question. Which company are you serving?  or where do you get your salary?\\n\\n> **A:** The Media Lab at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) pays my salary; I don’t receive regular payments from anybody else.\\n\\n> I have received small amounts of stock options in exchange for being a techical advisor to several Bitcoin companies (Coinbase, BitPay, Bloq, Xapo, Digital Currency Group, CoinLab, TruCoin, Chain) which might be worth money some day if one or more of those companies do very well. I make it very clear to these companies that my priority is to make Bitcoin better, and my goal in being an advisor to them is to learn more about the problems they face as they try to bring Bitcoin to more of their customers.\\n\\n> And I am sometimes (once or twice a year) paid to speak at events.\\n\\n**5.SaTuoXi**\\n \\n> **Q:** Would you mind share your opinion on lightning network? Is it complicated to implement? Does it need hard fork?\\n\\n\\n> **A:** Lightning does not need a hard fork.\\n\\n> It is not too hard to implement at the Bitcoin protocol level, but it is much more complicated to create a wallet capable of handling Lightning network payments properly.\\n\\n> I think Lightning is very exciting for new kinds of payments (like machine-to-machine payments that might happen hundreds of times per minute), but I am skeptical that it will be used for the kinds of payments that are common on the Bitcoin network today, because they will be more complicated both for wallet software and for people to understand.\\n\\n**6. pangcong**\\n\\n> **Q: 1)** There has been a lot of conferences related to blocksize limit. The two took place in HongKong in Decemeber of 2015 and Feberary of 2016 are the most important ones. Despite much opposition, it is undeniable that these two meetings basically determines the current status of Bitcoin. However, as the one of the original founders of Bitcoin, why did you choose to not attend these meetings? If you have ever attended and opposed gmax’s Core roadmap (SegWit Priority) in one of the meetings, we may be in a better situation now, and the 2M hard fork might have already begun. Can you explain your absence in the two meetings? Do you think the results of both meetings are orchestrated by blockstream?\\n\\n> **A: 1)** I attended the first scaling conference in Montreal in September of 2015, and had hoped that a compromise had been reached.\\n\\n> A few weeks after that conference, it was clear to me that whatever compromise had been reached was not going to happen, so it seemed pointless to travel all the way to Hong Kong in December for more discussion when all of the issues had been discussed repeatedly since February of 2015.\\n\\n> The February 2016 Hong Kong meeting I could not attend because I was invited only a short time before it happened and I had already planned a vacation with my family and grandparents.\\n\\n> I think all of those conferences were orchestrated mainly by people who do not think raising the block size limit is a high priority, and who want to see what problems happen as we run into the limit.\\n\\n> **Q: 2)** We have already known that gmax tries to limit the block size so as to get investment for his company. However, it is obvious that overthrowing Core is hard in the short term. What if Core continues to dominate the development of Bitcoin? Is it possible that blockstream core will never raise the blocksize limit because of their company interests?\\n\\n> **A: 2)** I don’t think investment for his company is Greg’s motivation-- I think he honestly believes that a solution like lightning is better technically.\\n\\n> He may be right, but I think it would be better if he considered that he might also be wrong, and allowed other solutions to be tried at the same time.\\n\\n> Blockstream is a funny company, with very strong-willed people that have different opinions. It is possible they will never come to an agreement on how to raise the blocksize limit.\\n\\n**7. HeiYanZhu**\\n\\n> **Q:** I would like to ask your opinion on the current situation. It’s been two years, but a simple 2MB hard fork could not even be done. In Bitcoin land, two years are incredibly long. Isn’t this enough to believe this whole thing is a conspiracy?\\n\\n> **A:** I don’t think it is a conspiracy, I think it is an honest difference of opinion on what is most important to do first, and a difference in opinion on risks and benefits of doing different things.\\n\\n> **Q:** How can a multi-billion network with millions of users and investors be choked by a handful of people? How can this be called decentrilized and open-source software anymore? It is so hard to get a simple 2MB hard fork, but SegWig and Lighting Network with thousands of lines of code change can be pushed through so fast. Is this normal? It is what you do to define if you are a good man, not what you say.\\n\\n> **A:** I still believe good engineers will work around whatever unnecessary barriers are put in their way-- but it might take longer, and the results will not be as elegant as I would prefer.\\n\\n> The risk is that people will not be patient and will switch to something else; the recent rapid rise in developer interest and price of Ethereum should be a warning.\\n\\n> **Q:** The problem now is that everybody knows Classic is better, however, Core team has controlled the mining pools using their powers and polical approaches. This made them controll the vast majority of the hashpower, no matter what others propose. In addition, Chinese miners have little communication with the community, and do not care about the developement of the system. Very few of them knows what is going on in the Bitcoin land. They almost handed over their own power to the mining pool, so as long as Core controls the pools, Core controls the whole Bitcoin, no matter how good your Classic is. Under this circumstance, what is your plan?\\n\\n> **A:** Encourage alternatives to Core. If they work better (if they are faster or do more) then Core will either be replaced or will have to become better itself. I am happy to see innovations happening in projects like Bitcoin Unlimited, for example. And just this week I see that Matt Corallo will be working on bringing an optmized protocol for relaying blocks into Core; perhaps that was the plan all along, or perhaps the “extreme thin blocks” work in Bitcoin Unlimited is making that a higher priority. In any case, competition is healthy.\\n\\n> **Q:** From this scaling debate, do you think there is a huge problem with Bitcoin development? Does there exsit development centrilization? Does this situation need improvment? For example, estabilish a fund from Bitcoin as a fundation. It can be used for hiring developers and maintainers, so that we can solve the development issue once and for all. \\n\\n> **A:** I think the Core project spends too much time thinking about small probability technical risks (like “rogue miners” who create hard-to-validate blocks or try to send invalid blocks to SPV wallets) and not enough time thinking about much larger non-technical risks.\\n\\n> And I think the Core project suffers from the common open source software problem of “developers developing for developers.”  The projects that get worked on are the technically interesting projects-- exciting new features (like the lightning network), and not improving the basic old features (like improving network performance or doing more code review and testing).\\n\\n> I think the situation is improving, with businesses investing more in development (but perhaps not in the Core project, because the culture of that project has become much less focused on short-term business needs and more on long-term exciting new features).\\n\\n> I am skeptical that crowd-funding software development can work well; if I look at other successful open source software projects, they are usually funded by companies, not individuals.\\n\\n**8.jb9802**\\n\\n> You are one of the most-repected person in Bitcoin world, I won’t miss the chance to ask some questions. First of all, I am a Classic supporter. I strongly believe that on-chain transcations should not be restrained artificially. Even if there are transcations that are willing to go through Lighting Network in the future, it should be because of a free market, not because of artificial restrication. Here are some of my questions:\\n \\n> **Q: 1)** For the past two years, you’ve been proposing to Core to scale Bitcoin. In the early days of the discussion, Core devs did agree that the blocksize should be raised. What  do you think is the major reason for Core to stall scaling. Does there exist conflict of interest between Blockstream and scaling?\\n\\n> **A: 1)** There might be unconscious bias, but I think there is just a difference of opinion on priorities and timing.\\n\\n> **Q: 2)** One of the reason for the Chinese to refuse Classic is that Classic dev team is not technically capable enough for future Bitcoin development. I also noticed that Classic does have a less frequent code release compared to Core. In your opinion, is there any solution to these problems? Have you ever thought to invite capable Chinese programers to join Classic dev team?\\n\\n> **A: 2)** The great thing about open source software is if you don’t think the development team is good enough (or if you think they are working on the wrong things) you can take the software and hire a better team to improve it.\\n\\n> Classic is a simple 2MB patch on top of Core, so it is intentional that there are not a lot of releases of Classic.\\n\\n> The priority for Classic right now is to do things that make working on Classic better for developers than working on Core, with the goal of attracting more developers. You can expect to see some results in the next month or two.\\n\\n> I invite capable programmers from anywhere, including China, to help any of the teams working on open source Bitcoin software, whether that is Classic or Core or Unlimited or bitcore or btcd or ckpool or p2pool or bitcoinj.\\n\\n> **Q: 3)**  Another reason for some of the Chinese not supporting Classic is that bigger blocks are more vulnerable to spam attacks. (However, I do think that smaller blocks are more vlunerable to spam attack, because smaller amount of money is needed to choke the blockchain.) What’s our opinion on this?\\n\\n> **A: 3)** The best response to a transaction spam attack is for the network to reject transactions that pay too little fees but to simply absorb any “spam” that is paying as much fees as regular transactions.\\n\\n> The goal for a transaction spammer is to disrupt the network; if there is room for extra transactions in blocks, then the network can just accept the spam (“thank you for the extra fees!”) and continue as if nothing out of the ordinary happened.\\n\\n> Nothing annoys a spammer more than a network that just absorbs the extra transactions with no harmful effects.\\n\\n> **Q: 4)** According to your understanding on lighting network and sidechains,if most Bitcoin transactions goes throught lighting network or sidechains, it possible that the fees paid on the these network cannot reach the main-chain miners, which leaves miners starving. If yes, how much percent do you think will be given to miners.\\n\\n> **A: 4)** I don’t know, it will depend on how often lightning network channels are opened and closed, and that depends on how people choose to use lightning.\\n\\n> Moving transactions off the main chain and on to the lightning network should mean less fees for miners, more for lightning network hubs. Hopefully it will also mean lower fees for users, which will make Bitcoin more popular, drive up the price, and make up for the lower transaction fees paid to miners.\\n\\n> **Q: 5)** The concept of lighting network and sidechains have been out of one or two years already, when do you think they will be fully deployed.\\n\\n> **A: 5)** Sidechains are already “fully deployed” (unless you mean the version of sidechains that doesn’t rely on some trusted gateways to move bitcoin on and off the sidechain, which won’t be fully deployed for at least a couple of years). I haven’t seen any reports of how successful they have been.\\n\\n> I think Lightning will take longer than people estimate.  Seven months ago Adam Back said that the lightning network might be ready “as soon as six months from now” … but I would be surprised if there was a robust, ready-for-everybody-to-use lightning-capable wallet before 2018.\\n\\n> **Q: 6)**Regarding the hard fork, Core team has assumed that it will cause a chain-split. (Chinese miners are very intimitated by this assumption, I think this is the major reason why most of the Chinese mining pools are not switching to Classic). Do you think Bitcoin will have a chain-split?\\n\\n> **A: 6)** No, there will not be a chain split. I have not talked to a single mining pool operator, miner, exchange, or major bitcoin business who would be willing to mine a minority branch of the chain or accept bitcoins from a minority branch of the main chain.\\n\\n> **Q: 7)** From your point of view, do you think there is more Classic supporters or Core supporters in the U.S.?\\n\\n> **A: 7)** All of the online opinion pools that have been done show that a majority of people worldwide support raising the block size limit.\\n\\n**9. btcc123**\\n\\n> **Q:** Which is more in line with the Satoshi’s original roadmap, Bitcoin Classic or Bitcoin Core? How to make mining pools support and adopt Bitcoin Classic?\\n\\n> **A:** Bitcoin Classic is more in line with Satoshi’s original roadmap.\\n\\n> We can’t make the mining pools do anything they don’t want to do, but they are run by smart people who will do what they think is best for their businesses and Bitcoin.\\n\\n**10.KuHaiBian**\\n\\n> **Q:** Do you have any solution for mining centralization? What do you think about the hard fork of changing mining algorithms?\\n\\n> **A:** I have a lot of thoughts on mining centralization; it would probably take ten or twenty pages to write them all down.\\n\\n> I am much less worried about mining centralization than most of the other developers, because Satoshi designed Bitcoin so miners make the most profit when they do what is best for Bitcoin. I have also seen how quickly mining pools come and go; people were worried that the DeepBit mining pool would become too big, then it was GHash.io…\\n\\n> And if a centralized mining pool does become too big and does something bad, the simplest solution is for businesses or people to get together and create or fund a competitor. Some of the big Bitcoin exchanges have been seriously considering doing exactly that to support raising the block size limit, and that is exactly the way the system is supposed to work-- if you don’t like what the miners are doing, then compete with them!\\n\\n> I think changing the mining algorithm is a complicated solution to a simple problem, and is not necessary.\\n\\n**11. ChaLi**\\n\\n> **Q:** Last time you came to China, you said you want to \"make a different\". I know that in USA the opposition political party often hold this concept, in order to prevent the other party being totally dominant. Bitcoin is born with a deep \"make a different\" nature inside. But in Chinese culture, it is often interpreted as split “just for the sake of splitting”, can you speak your mind on what is your meaning of \"make a different\"? \\n\\n> **A:** I started my career in Silicon Valley, where there is a lot of competition but also a lot of cooperation. The most successful companies find a way to be different than their competitors; it is not a coincidence that perhaps the most successful company in the world (Apple Computer) had the slogan “think different.”\\n\\n> As Bitcoin gets bigger (and I think we all agree we want Bitcoin to get bigger!) it is natural for it to split and specialize; we have already seen that happening, with lots of choices for different wallets, different exchanges, different mining chips, different mining pool software.\\n\\n**12. bluestar**\\n\\n> **Q: 1)** The development of XT and Classic confirmed my thoughts that it is nearly impossible to use a new version of bitcoin to replace the current bitcoin Core controlled by Blockstream. I think we will have to live with the power of Blockstream for a sufficient long time. It means we will see the deployment of SegWit and Lighting network. If it really comes to that point, what will you do? Will you also leave like Mike Hearn? \\n\\n> **A: 1)** With the development of Blockchain, bitcoin will grow bigger and bigger without any doubts,  And also there will be more and more companies related to the bitcoin network. When it comes to money, there will be a lot of fights between these companies. Is it possible to form some kind of committee to avoid harmful fights between these companies and also the situation that a single company controlling the direction of the bitcoin development? Is there any one doing this kind of job right now? \\n\\n> **Q: 2)** My final question would be, do you really think it is possible that we can have a decentralized currency? Learning from the history, it seems like every thing will become centralized as long as it involves human. Do you have any picture for a decentralized currency or even a society? Thanks. \\n\\n> **A: 2)** I think you might be surprised at what most people are running a year or three from now. Perhaps it will be a future version of Bitcoin Core, but I think there is a very good chance another project will be more successful.\\n\\n> I remember when “everybody” was running Internet Explorer or Firefox, and people thought Google was crazy to think that Chrome would ever be a popular web browser. It took four years for Chrome to become the most popular web browser.\\n\\n> In any case, I plan on working on Bitcoin related projects for at least another few years. Eventually it will become boring or I will decide I need to take a couple of years of and think about what I want to do next.\\n\\n> As for fights between companies: there are always fights between companies, in every technology. There are organizations like the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) that try to create committees so engineers at companies can spend more time cooperating and less time fighting; I’m told by people who participate in IETF meetings that they are usually helpful and create useful standards more often than not.\\n\\n> Finally, yes, I do think we can have a “decentralized-enough” currency. A currency that might be controlled at particular times by a small set of people or companies, but that gives everybody else the ability to take control if those people or businesses misbehave.\\n\\n\\n**13. satoshi**\\n\\n> Hi Gavin, I have some questions:\\n\\n> **Q: 1)** I noticed there are some new names added to the classic team list. Most people here only know you and Jeff. Can you briefly introduce some others to the Chinese community?\\n\\n> **A: 1)** \\n\\n> Tom Zander has been acting as lead developer, and is an experienced C++ developer who worked previously on the Qt and Debian open source projects.\\n\\n> Pedro Pinheiro is on loan from Blockchain.info, and has mostly worked on continuous integration and testing for Classic.\\n\\n> Jon Rumion joined recently, and has been working on things that will make life for developers more pleasant (I don’t want to be more specific, I don’t want to announce things before they are finished in case they don’t work out).\\n\\n> Jeff has been very busy starting up Bloq, so he hasn’t been very active with Classic recently. I’ve also been very busy traveling (Barbados, Idaho, London and a very quick trip to Beijing) so haven’t been writing much code recently.\\n\\n> **Q: 2)** if bitcoin classic succeeded (>75% threshold), what role would you play in the team after the 2MB upgrade finished, as a leader, a code contributor, a consultant, or something else?\\n\\n> **A: 2)**Contributor and consultant-- I am trying not to be leader of any software project right now, I want to leave that to other people who are better at managing and scheduling and recruiting and all of the other things that need to be done to lead a software project.\\n\\n> **Q: 3)** if bitcoin classic end up failed to achieve mainstream adoption (<75% 2018), will you continue the endeavor of encouraging on-chain scaling and garden-style growth of bitcoin?\\n\\n> **A: 3)** Yes. If BIP109 does not happen, I will still be pushing to get a good on-chain solution to happen as soon as possible.\\n\\n> **Q: 4)** Have you encountered any threat in your life, because people would think you obviously have many bitcoins, like what happened to Hal Finney (RIP), or because some people have different ideas about what bitcoin\\'s future should be?\\n\\n> **A: 4)** No, I don’t think I have received any death threats. It upsets me that other people have.\\n\\n> Somebody did threaten to release my and my wife’s social security numbers and other identity information if I did not pay them some bitcoins a couple of years ago. I didn’t pay, they did release our information, and that has been a little inconvenient at times.\\n\\n> **Q: 5)** Roger Ver (Bitcoin Jesus) said bitcoin would worth thousands of dollars. Do you have similar thoughts? If not, what is your opinion on bitcoin price in future?\\n\\n> **A: 5)** I learned long ago to give up trying to predict the price of stocks, currencies, or Bitcoin. I think the price of Bitcoin will be higher in ten years, but I might be wrong.\\n\\n> **Q: 6)** You\\'ve been to China. What\\'s your impression about the country, people, and the culture here? Thank you!\\n\\n> **A: 6)** I had a very quick trip to Beijing a few weeks ago-- not nearly long enough to get a good impression of the country or the culture.\\n\\n> I had just enough time to walk around a little bit one morning, past the Forbidden City and walk around Tianmen Square. There are a LOT of people in China, I think the line to go into the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall was the longest I have ever seen!\\n\\n> Beijing reminded me a little bit of London, with an interesting mix of the very old with the very new. The next time I am in China I hope I can spend at least a few weeks and see much more of the country; I like to be in a place long enough so that I really can start to understand the people and cultures.\\n\\n**14. Pussinboots**\\n\\n> **Q:** Dear Gavin, How could I contact you, we have an excellent team and good plans. please confirm your linkedin.\\n\\n> **A:** Best contact for me is gavinandresen@gmail.com : but I get lots of email, please excuse me if your messages get lost in the flood.\\n\\n> **15. satoshi**\\n\\n> **Q:** Gavin, you\\'ve been both core and classic code contributor. Are there any major differences between the two teams, concerning code testing (quality control) and the release process of new versions?\\n\\n> **A:** Testing and release processes are the same; a release candidate is created and tested, and once sufficiently tested, a final release is created, cryptographically signed by several developers, and then made available for download.\\n\\n> The development process for Classic will be a little bit different, with a ‘develop’ branch where code will be pulled more quickly and then either fixed or reverted based on how testing goes. The goal is to create a more developer-friendly process, with pull requests either accepted or rejected fairly quickly.\\n\\n**16. tan90d**\\n\\n> I am a bitcoin enthusiast and a coin holder. I thank you for your great contribution to bitcoin. Please allow me to state some of my views before asking:\\n\\n> 1. I\\'m on board with classic\\n\\n> 2. I support the vision to make bitcoin a powerful currency that could compete with Visa\\n\\n> 3. I support segwit, so I\\'ll endorse whichever version of bitcoin implementation that upgrades to segwit, regardless of block size.\\n\\n> 4. I disagree with those who argue bitcoin main blockchain should be a settlement network with small blocks. My view is that on the main chain btc should function properly as a currency, as well as a network for settlement.\\n\\n> 5. I\\'m against the deployment of LN on top of small block sized blockchain. Rather, it should be built on a chain with bigger blocks.\\n\\n> 6. I also won’t agree with the deployment of many sidechains on top of small size block chain. Rather, those sidechains should be on chain with bigger blocks.\\n\\n> With that said, below are my questions:\\n\\n> **Q: 1)** If bitcoin is developed following core\\'s vision, and after the 2020 halving which cuts block reward down to 6.125BTC, do you think the block transaction fee at that time will exceed 3BTC?\\n\\n> **A: 1)** If the block limit is not raised, then no, I don’t think transaction fees will be that high.\\n\\n> **Q: 2)** If bitcoin is developed following classic\\'s vision, and after the 2020 halving which cuts block reward down to 6.125BTC, do you think the block transaction fee at that time will exceed 3BTC?\\n\\n> **A: 2)** Yes, the vision is lots of transactions, each paying a very small fee, adding up to a big total for the miners.\\n\\n> **Q: 3)** If bitcoin is developed following core\\'s vision, do you think POW would fail  in future,  because the mining industry might be accounted too low value compared with that of the bitcoin total market, so that big miners could threaten btc market and gain profit by shorting?\\n\\n> *The questioner further explained his concern. \\n\\n> Currently, its about ~1.1 billion CNY worth of mining facilities protecting ~42 billion CNY worth (6.5 Billion USD) of bitcoin market. The ratio is ~3%. If bitcoin market cap continues to grow and we adopt layered development plan, the mining portion may decrease, pushing the ratio go even down to <1%, meaning we are using very small money protecting an huge expensive system. For example, in 2020 if bitcoin market cap is ~100 billion CNY, someone may attempt to spend ~1 billion CNY bribe/manipulate miners to attack the network, thus making a great fortune by shorting bitcoin and destroying the ecosystem.\\n\\n> **A: 3)** Very good question, I have asked that myself. I have asked people if they know if there have been other cases where people destroyed a company or a market to make money by shorting it -- as far as I know, that does not happen. Maybe because it is impossible to take a large short position and remain anonymous, so even if you were successful, you would be arrested for doing whatever you did to destroy the company or market (e.g. blow up a factory to destroy a company, or double-spend fraud to try to destroy Bitcoin).\\n\\n> **Q: 4)** If bitcoin is developed following classic\\'s vision, will the blocks become too big that kill decentralization?\\n\\n> **A: 4)** No, if you look at how many transactions the typical Internet connection can support, and how many transactions even a smart phone can validate per second, we can support many more transactions today with the hardware and network connections we have now.\\n\\n> And hardware and network connections are getting faster all the time.\\n\\n> **Q: 5)** In theory, even if we scale bitcoin with just LN and sidechains, the main chain still needs blocks with size over 100M, in order to process the trading volume matching Visa\\'s network. So does core have any on-chain scaling plan other than 2MB? Or Core does not plan to evolve bitcoin into something capable of challenging visa?\\n\\n> **A: 5)** Some of the Core developer talk about a “flexcap” solution to the block size limit, but there is no specific proposal.\\n\\n> I think it would be best to eliminate the limit all together. That sounds crazy, but the most successful Internet protocols have no hard upper limits (there is no hard limit to how large a web page may be, for example), and no protocol limit is true to Satoshi’s original design.\\n\\n> **Q: 6)** If (the majority of) hash rate managed to switch to Classic in 2018, will the bitcoin community witness the deployment of LN in two years (~2018)?\\n\\n> **A: 6)** The bottleneck with Lightning Network will be wallet support, not support down at the Bitcoin protocol level. So I don’t think the deployment schedule of LN will be affected much whether Classic is adopted or not.\\n\\n> **Q: 7)** If (majority) hash rate upgraded to blocks with segwit features in 2017 as specified in core\\'s roadmap, would classic propose plans to work on top of that (blocks with segwit)? Or insist developing simplified segwit blocks as described in classic\\'s roadmap? \\n\\n> **A: 7)** Classic will follow majority hash rate. It doesn’t make sense to do anything else.\\n\\n> **Q: 8)** If most hash rate is still on core\\'s side before 2018, will you be disappointed with bitcoin, and announce that bitcoin has failed like what Mike did, and sell all your stashed coins at some acceptable price?\\n\\n> **A: 8)** No-- I have said that I think if the block size limit takes longer to resolve, that is bad for Bitcoin in the short term, but smart engineers will work around whatever road blocks you put in front of them. I see Bitcoin as a long-term project.\\n\\n> **Q: 9)** If we have most hash rate switched to classic\\'s side before 2018, what do you think will be the fate of Blockstream company?\\n\\n> **A: 9)** I think Blockstream might lose some employees, but otherwise I don’t think it will matter much. They are still producing interesting technology that might become a successful business.\\n\\n> **Q: 10)** If we have most hash rate still on core\\'s side before 2018, what do you think will be the fate of Blockstream company?\\n\\n> **A: 10)** I don’t think Blockstream’s fate depends on whether or not BIP109 is adopted. It depends much more on whether or not they find customers willing to pay for the technology that they are developing.\\n\\n> **Q: 11)** If we have most hash rate still on core\\'s side before 2018, what do you think will be the fate of companies that support classic, such as Coinbse, bitpay, and Blockchain.info?\\n\\n> **A: 11)** We have already seen companies like Kraken support alternative currencies (Kraken supports Litecoin and Ether); if there is no on-chain scaling solution accepted by the network, I think we will see more companies “hedging their bets” by supporting other currencies that have a simpler road map for supporting more transactions.\\n\\n> **Q: 12)** If we have most hash rate switched to classic\\'s side before 2018, will that hinder the development of sidechain tech? What will happen to companies like Rockroot(Rootstock?) ?\\n\\n> **A: 12)** No, I think the best use of sidechains is for things that might be too risky for the main network (like Rootstock) or are narrowly focused on a small number of Bitcoin users. I don’t think hash rate supporting Classic will have any effect on that.\\n\\n> **Q: 13)** Between the two versions of bitcoin client, which one is more conducive to mining industry, classic or core?\\n\\n> **A: 13)** I have been working to make Classic better for the mining industry, but right now they are almost identical so it would be dishonest to say one is significantly better than the other. \\n\\n**17. Alfred**\\n\\n> **Q:** Gavin, can you describe what was in your mind when you first learned bitcoin?\\n\\n> **A:** I was skeptical that it could actually work! I had to read everything I could about it, and then read the source code before I started to think that maybe it could actually be successful and was not a scam.',\n",

Disk space per dollar has been increasing at 40%/year and FALLING.\\n\\nOf these three laws, and unless there is a paradigm shift in one or more of these laws, it appears that disk space will be the limiting factor in the future.\\n\\nThe blockchain itself has doubled in size over the last year. (100%). This is already outpacing the three laws listed above!\\n\\nIf we stick to 1 MB blocks for now, the blockchain will increase by 72% over the next year, 42% the year after, and 29% after that and so on.\\n\\nA switch to classic today (assuming full classic blocks) would increase the blockchain size by 146% at this time next year, wildly outpacing the disk space cost progression.\\n\\nTo me, all of this math says that Core's path is the correct one. Although the network sorely needs to increase capacity, even sticking to 1 MB at this time will lead to decentralization over the next couple of years as the blockchain size becomes too large for some people to run their nodes (although probably not many).\\n\\nTo me, the scaling solution should be to follow the law that is the most limiting (currently disk space). \\n\\n- Therefore, block size should not increase until the cost per unit of space per year is decreasing at a rate that is MORE THAN OR EQUAL TO the increase of the blockchain size per year.\\n\\nUnder current conditions and without segwit, this wouldn't happen until 2-4 years, and from then on would only increase at the rate that cost of disk space drops (currently 40% per year).\\n\\nPlease let me know if I went wrong somewhere.

I\\'ve seen some of the core devs being concerned about this, but\\nI have the impression, that almost everybody in Core is now ok with risking Bitcoins \\nsafety, to please some people, that don\\'t have the patience to wait for Lightning etc.\\n\\nI want to run a fully validating node, but I don\\' think I can run a node, that\\nhas to handle much more than the current blocksize. And Segwit actually \\nwill stress my bandwidth more. (The high number of ~1 MB blocks lately has already been \\nmore, than Bitcoin should handle, to have nodes run from home). While I think, that\\nthe 1 MB limit can\\'t possibly be reduced in the current climate, I think it could be \\nreduced in the future, when Lightning takes the load of the node operators. \\n\\nWhat I absolutely don\\'t want, is to have a higher limit at the moment. \\n\\nSo my proposal is, to implement Segwit (for all the benefits is has, that \\nare even acknowledged by 1 GB block proponents), but to leave the size of all data\\nto be transferred at 1 MB (Witness + non-Witness Data <= 1 MB).\\n\\nThe advantages of the Blocksize increase (appeasing the big-block-side) don\\'t\\nremotely justify the risks it brings. I suspect we will see a lot of home-run nodes \\nleaving the network. And I don\\'t think it\\'s very probable, that these nodes come back,\\nif the limit is reduced later on.\\n\\nIf you look back, I think it was shown impressively, that the fears of the \\nbig-blockers didn\\'t materialize, while the idea of the fee market actually works\\nvery well. And I think (while I know, that this is impossible to achieve right now),\\nthat a reduction to ~500 kB would actually work even better.\\n\\nYou can already see, that the bigblock side is not satisfied with the blocksize\\nincrease by Segwit, and that it is unlikely, that the attacks will stop, when segwit\\nactivates. On the other hand, I think, that Bitcoin core (looking for example at the \\ncount of active nodes) has a lot of suppport from Bitcoiners. And that comes, because\\nCore values the important properties of Bitcoin. Why should you reduce decentralization?\\nIs there a reason, to increase the blocksize, except for giving in to a loud minority, \\nthat won\\'t be pleased, however big the increase will be?\\n\\ntl;dr: Please implement Segwit, as it is a great step forward, but not with the current\\nhidden blocksize increase.

What is \\'storage penalty\\' in percent for an avg. TX mix?\"\\n\\nSo my question is NOT: \"How much more TXs can you transmit with segwit using 2016\\'s TX mix?\" I know the answer to this is \"+70%..+100%\" or \"an equivalent of 1.7 to 2MB of legacy TX data\" (dpdt. on assumptions).\\n\\nThis is an entirely different question.\\n\\nMy Q.2 above is asking for HDD space efficiency of the new world (incl. segwit) compared to the old world (today).

       "  'For some background, I\\'m a second wave investor (from somewhere in 2013). I invested a fairly large % of my net worth in Bitcoin at the time and that now represents an even bigger % of my net worth. I own my fair share of bitcoins. I\\'ve also been closely following everything since then while going through the rollercoaster.\\n\\nI\\'m not going to argue the merits of segwit or the different blocksize increase attempts. But to be completely transparent, at the moment I support segwit adoption and I\\'m leaning towards a reasonable/cautious blocksize increase. I hope this issue can be fixed for good through some automation in the (probably far) future. I\\'ve long been a staunch core supporter as you can verify if you check my post history.\\n\\nWhat I want to argue about however is about the fear of a hardfork. This is such a touchy subject that I think advocating for a bitcoin implementation that would lead to a hardfork is currently banned from r/bitcoin. Which in my mind is dangerous.\\n\\nI think the first mistake is to name a hardfork of Bitcoin, an altcoin. This doesn\\'t make any difference between a random token that copied part of Bitcoin\\'s code base and a ledger that shares all the transaction history of Bitcoin from the Genesis block until the time of the split. Therefore in order to avoid confusion, I\\'d rather name the result of a hard-fork, an alt-bitcoin.\\n\\nAs a Bitcoin holder, I felt like I had to protect myself from the risks of another ledger overtaking Bitcoin and in order to do this I decided to buy any altcoin that would be over a certain treshold or that I thought would have a chance to threaten Bitcoin hegemony for different reasons. This is both very costly and very annoying. But the prudent investor tries to hedge when he has to.\\n\\nThere is nothing more that investors dislike than uncertainty. At the same time Bitcoin holds a very big promise, ideally it\\'s supposed to provide an alternative to the current worldwide monetary system so it needs to be tested in fire. It needs to show it really is anti-fragile. And for that we can\\'t just sweep perceived fragilities under the rug, we need to attack them and the honeybadger needs to get back on its feets.\\n\\nContentious hardforks are seen as a big risk by many people. Ethereum was shown as the bad example not to follow. Because contentious hardforks results into 2 coins. Even a hardfork that would appear not contentious at first might result in 2 coins so some people argue we should never hardfork.\\n\\nThe problem is you can fear it, you can cover your eyes or your ears, you can prevent talking about it, but in the end, it\\'s still possible to harfork, it\\'s not that dificult and anything that can happen will eventually happen so we better get ready for it.\\n\\nCurrently the community is split into 2 parts of which we don\\'t know the exact percentage. It could be anywhere from 90/10 to 50/50. We can see the point of view of both sides on their respective subreddits. I think this split is the result of a divergence of view that won\\'t go away. More than that, I think that maybe Bitcoin can\\'t do everything at the same time? Maybe there will be a need for a corporate Bitcoin and an crypto-anarchist Bitcoin. Today people argue about blocksize and decentralisation. Tomorrow they will argue about privacy or any other subject.\\n\\nI feel like the only way to solve this is through a contentious hardfork. Maybe 2 bitcoins will survive, maybe more, maybe not. Am I afraid of a short term price crash ? Yes, let\\'s not kid ourselves. Traders will exploit any moment of fear and greed. But the more we talk about the possibility of a hardfork and the more \"priced in\" it will be. This shouldn\\'t come as a surprise.\\n\\nMore than that, I would say that from the perspective on an investor trying to get into Bitcoin at the moment, I would be very worried about the uncertainties of a future hardfork. Because it has never happened and I don\\'t know how the market and how the network are going to react. When we have been through this once and acknowledged the possibility of it, there will be less uncertainties. More investors will be able to invest knowing bitcoin stood in the fire of the hardfork and came out alive.\\n\\nAnother good point is that I\\'d rather have 2 bitcoins forging ahead and occupying their respective markets or fighting for domination rather than leaving the door for altcoins to take over in these fields left to them. Because I already own Bitcoins, I\\'d rather not have to buy other tokens.  Eventually the market will decide if we need only one or two or more. I don\\'t think there is a definitive answer at the moment on that. But I think money has tremendous network effects.\\n\\nFingers will be pointed at Ethereum eth/etc but I would say that many people ignored the possibility of 2 coins before their hardfork and now we know. We are already better prepared to deal with a hardfork than we were before the eth/etc split.\\n\\nWill it create a lot of troubles ? Very possibly... Exchanges will have deal with this, payment processors will have to deal with this, wallets, holders, it might be a mess, bad publicity and so on... Price might come under pressure. Investors might wait out to see which coin is going to win.\\n\\nBut we have this sword hanging over our neck, and I\\'d rather see it on the floor. Altcoins already own 10 to 20% of the crypto marketshare depending on the time. Some investors are already holding out to see if Bitcoin or Ethereum is going to win. A hardfork will show that the true power of Bitcoin is not in its open source technology, it\\'s in the ledger.\\n\\nSo let\\'s not be fearful of hardforks because ultimately we can\\'t avoid them, instead we should prepare ourselves to be ready and discuss it as much as possible.',\n",

       "  '> In the article Why support SegWit, COO of BTCC give his answers, Samson Mow focused on SegWit without mentioning the real problem: the post-segwit roadmap from Core. I just have to clarify something Mr.Mow is unwilling to touch.\\n\\n**I.The True Focus: Core’s Roadmap**\\nMr.Mow brags about the benefits of segwit in his article, and accuses scaling side on anti-core being political. Truth is, however, scaling side is pro segwit and LN as well. Scaling side is anti core’s roadmap, which is, from soft-forked segwit implementation to permanent limit of block size on 1 MB. This will turn the main chain into a SWIFT-like settlement network. High tx fee on the main chain will chase all the daily tx away to the LN.\\nWhy Core’s roadmap is wrong? Simple logic: more is better than less, more options are always better than fewer ones.\\n “I’m right so I will take your rights away”---this is a dangerous mindset. Just look at the history of Communism and the possible millions of deaths associated with it. A vicious fruit of a vicious mentality. Why in China’s Big Leap in the 60s we saw millions of deaths of peasants? Because they were restricted to their own land by the low level party bodies and the household registration system, preventing them from fleeing their land. There’s no option but to starve to death.\\nHow can someone be so sure that he’s right? What if he’s wrong? How can he shoulder the responsibility of millions of lives? Can core do that? Who gave the right to Core from prevent us from using the main chain? Is core capable of shouldering the responsibility of the doom of Bitcoin?\\n\\n**II.Fragile LN**\\nSecondary networks like LN can only be a supplement to the main chain, not a replacement to it. LN’s big nodes have clearly capital, efficiency and operation advantages. Looking upon them to maintain many small nodes is so childish. There will be Matthew Effect. There will be big fish devouring small fish. LN, in the end, will be dominated by big players like what we see with Alipay/Wechat Pay today. Decentralization will be a banned word.\\nRumors recently mentioned “Chinese monetary authorities are looking to limit the transfer of Bitcoin from domestic exchanges to their foreign counterparts. Crypto community lived on such a joke. But can you laugh when tx are all running on giants-dominated LN?\\nLN operators cannot confiscate your Bitcoin, but they can, with the excuses of regulation compliance, ask you to conduct compliance checks. You want to quit then? To where? Main chain? Core had it in mind already: 1MB block size is only for big-amount LN tx settlement, the tx fee will be as high as with the SWIFT. How about 100 dollars per tx? Quit?\\n\\n**III.Dangerous Soft-Fork SegWit**\\nCore is implementing segwit through softfork, that is by lying to old nodes to realize compatibility. This brings significant technical risks and hefty tech debts.\\nWith bottom layer data structure altered, Core wants to lie to old nodes so as to fool them into believing “nothing-has-changed”. This is just as difficult as the twisted hand in the pic above. The risks and debts behind it are so self-explanatory. We can already expect tremendous difficulty in the future development that will be based on this twisted hand.\\nWhy Core says “SegWit almost changed every line of Bitcoin’s codes?” (They wanted to brag about the workload).\\nBased on the HK consensus, the segwit should have been out in Apr. and online since Jul.,why is it so late in Nov. even under the pressure from consensus and miners? Because core wanted to build a twisted hand.\\nSystemic complexity rising echoes with a falling stability. We all have seen the price of ETH’s Turing-Completeness: four or five HFs and lots of nodes being attacked into destruction. Bitcoin, as a formally 10B level financial system: Can it pay such a high price? Can Core take that responsibility?\\n\\n**IV.Enough Block Size**\\nIf our network cannot take 1MB+ block size, Core’s limit can be justified. But the reality is that even the GFC-limited Chinese pools can accept an 8MB size, see the pic below (in June last year): \\npictures here:\\n[https://bitkan.com/news/topic/25778](https://bitkan.com/news/topic/25778)\\n\\nCompared with “who’s-your-daddy” Core, BU is not so condescending to the very least:\\n**1)block size? Pool decides. No 50%+ pools will choose too high of a size that the network cannot take. (or they suffer from high orphanage rate).**\\n**2)tx fee? Market decides. Should the network unable to take a big block size, the limited block supply from pools will raise the tx fee to an equilibrium point on the market.**\\n**3)LN or not? Tx fee decides. If the network cannot take big size blocks, while LN is cheap and fast, why not use it under high tx fee scenarios?**\\nI think 2) is not going to happen. I used a 56k modem back in junior high, and I use a 200M optical fiber connection today at 17 dollars per month. That’s a 4,000 times scaling. But I’m not against 3). Core, however, considers 2) as fate, so “I’m your daddy let me decide for you.” So they castrate the main chain tx and decide for you that future tx should go through the LN.\\nWhy such a rush? Who’s the “GOD”, Core or the market? Or the reason being that Core’s daddy BS is the standard maker of LN?\\n\\n**V.Who is qualified to take responsibilities when it comes to Bitcoin security?**\\nWhat is the consequence of Core breaking Bitcoin the big toy? Leave. That’s it. So many Internet companies are out there and a glorified ex-Bitcoin developer will surely find a new job.\\nOnly miners, who invested millions-worth of personal wealth, the sunk cost, cannot leave like a bitcoiner, thus can be qualified as the Bitcoin’s safe guards. Mt.Gox was bearing the Bitcoin price in hope to cover up for their loss. Only miners want the Bitcoin to thrive with more users and a bullish market.\\n**I can conclude with great confidence: SegWit will never ever be activated. It’s not about the 95% threshold. Even in 75% or 51% scenarios it will not be alive.**\\n**Why? I am a miner, a member of the mining pools. I invested millions of real wealth into the mining business.\\nGot an issue?

There appears to be numerous reasonably safe\\nways to do such a hard fork (e.g. first soft fork to miners who support the hard fork)\\nbut that is out of scope for this.\\n\\n\\nBlock weight limit voting would add a new field to the block header \"ideal block weight\" that represents the ideal block weight limit (in KiB) that the miner of that block would like to be the networks new block weight limit.\\n\\nIf more than 95% of all blocks during a retargeting period are voting for a new weight limit\\nthat represents an increase or decrease from the current weight limit, the new\\nblock weight limit would be moved to where 95% support exists. As a safety feature, the block weight limit change would be capped at a hard 5% change per retarget period.\\n\\n\\n**Q&A:**\\n\\n> Why is it block weight, and not block size?\\n\\nBlock weight is what segwit uses, and a better limit in general. It also wouldn\\'t be\\nmuch of a compromise proposal if tried to exclude segwit.\\n\\n\\n> Why don\\'t miners vote for block weight by making blocks of that size?\\n\\nBecause this would severely disadvantage a miner who wants to have both smaller blocks but also maximize their income. \\n\\n> Why is there a 95% threshold, and not 51% or somewhere in between?\\n\\nBecause there exists inherent conflicts of interests between miners and bitcoin users,\\n95% is a very conservative number that errs on the side of caution and helps protect\\nminority powers against more centralized mining. This number is also well established in soft forks, as miner preference is also only considered a rough proxy for the bitcoin economy at large, it makes sense to be very\\nconservative.\\n\\n\\n**Thoughts?

Also there was no actual value to be protected. Had Bitcoin been destroyed by some event, from the perspective back then, some thousands of $$ would have been burnt.

Actually it’s just a redesign based on Bitcoin Core as 99% of the codes are still those of Bitcoin Core. BU just has made some tiny changes. In developing BU, there are serval bugs in BU but they claim these bugs are just bugs from Bitcoin Core itself. Members from Core can tell the so called “bugs from Bitcoin Core itself” are simply caused by BU’s developers. BU is bad at coding and BU has not been through thorough tests. Many coders including Chinese and Westerners all thought BU’s codes are bad.\\n\\nBesides, BU team actually has achieved nothing till now. If we say Bitcoin is a Ferrari with 100 Core members maintaining it, then BU team simply don’t know what a Ferrari is. BU only repairs bikes or even bikes are beyond their ability. All of these are because BU never has created or maintained any crypto currency. They even have never released any altcoin. I would rather believe in MaidSafeCoin or Dash’s teams than believe in BU.\\n\\nFurthermore. BU changed the bitcoin’s rule of “ consensus-based principle”. BU is not based on consensus. Bitcoin’s rules are not made for mining but for users to decide the blocksize based on consensus. In order to gain support, BU now suddenly say bitcoin is created for mining, which is actually not even the thought of the developers of BU. Developers(of BU) also said they need to make some changes to conform to the consensus-based principle of bitcoin.\\n\\nBU is just a form of political maneuvering that is being taken advantage of, just like Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic. Those who support BU are actually not all for BU. The want to achieve their ulterior motives by supporting BU, say they want to scale blocksize, to alienate Core team or they just want to prove they are correct. Their reasons for supporting BU are all far-fetched or wrong.\\n\\n\\n(from ID Bitcoiners)\\nQ :Does BTCC support onchain scaling ?\\n\\nYes, BTCC support onchain scaling.:)\\n\\nWe support any plan of scaling both on and off chain as long as they are safe and have been under thorough tests. SegeWit in essence is onchain scaling as it can make the block size bigger and enlarge the effective capacity of the blockchain for bitcoins.\\n\\nMany people still think SW is not onchain scaling. But in fact SW is the fastest scaling onchain plan till now. Most of the people within the community oppose a hasty hard-fork; If we can reach consensus on SW, then we can achieve onchain scaling in several months, making it a reality to have bigger blocksize and capacity for more transactions.  \\n\\n\\nQ:BTCC supports SW as mining pool(miners) or as an exchange.\\n\\nA: we support SW as believe it can improve bitcoin and enlarge the capacity of block, making outstanding technologies like lighting possible. This will bring an all win situation for bitcoin’s traders, miners, buyers or holders. We have made the supportive decision based on our analysis of it and its future potential.\\n\\n\\nQ: under what circumstances will BTCC give up running a bitcoin app in production with activated SW soft-fork?\\n\\n\\nI don’t think I have any reason to give up SegeWit till now as it will bring many improvements to bitcoin. It fixes bitcoin’s malleability. If SW is activated, the use of lightening network becomes possible. So from technical angle, I will not give up SW.\\n\\nBut there are also chances for us to give up SW. Like if other mining pools give us pressure then we may make concessions. If the activation phase of SW comes to an end, then we might also give up SW. But in general, till now I do not see any reason not to support SW. SW is a technical progress instead of a political fight. It should not be affected by others’ emotion or preferences. SW is a technical changes of bitcoin’s the core codes.\\n\\nIf political fight in the bitcoin community results in joint pressure mounting to us, I would say this is not the situation we want to see. We need to make decisions based on the pros and cons of the SW, and on the consensus of the Core’s team members as Core’s members are all excellent programmers. These coders spent a lot of time considering the situation to explore the best scaling solution to fix problems that most of the ordinary people feel hard to understand. If others’ pressure makes us unable to run SW or we press others to run SW, the situation will be bad. I think every should make decisions based on the pros and cons of technicals.\\n\\nCurrently there are many rumors and misgiving within Chinese community. Many people are maligning SW. Like some people are claiming Core will change the POW into PoS; SW is poison; SW is not onchain scaling, or the lighting network will carve up miners’ benefits…all of these are rumors without any source. SW is indeed onchain scaling. Except BU, no developer or engineer would say SW is not onchain sacling.\\n\\n\\nQ: Won’t BTCC follow the 2015 Beijing Pool Declaration and 2016 Hong Kong Consensus anymore?\\n \\nA: This seems to be a question of common concerns. I would like to reply in details. Wish it can be clearer for all.\\n\\nFor 2015 Beijng Mining Pool Declaration, there is a long story behind it. You can’t say what happed a year ago equally applies in today’s situation as both internet world and crypto area are evolving fast. The Consensus was actually response to Bitcoin XT, when Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn firstly incited political fight within bitcoin community which has been witnessed by many mining pools.\\n\\nAt that time. Mike and Gavin tried to contact us quite frequently. They lobbied us and wanted us to use their Bitcoin XT. They said it can scale the blocksize into a 20MB one. They said the block was going to be full and actions must be taken. It’s until now that we are aware that it’s natural for the block to be full. If there is no full block, then there is no profits for the miners. The block space must maintain its scarcity to be valuable. But at that time we were not familiar with technical stuff and didn’t know how capable the Mike and Gavin were. We just knew 20MB was really bigger than 1MB and many other mining pools also felt the need to act so we were also a bit worried. But after some consideration, we believe to have 8MB block size was rather safe. To scale to 8 MB is referred to the Bitcoin XT’s plan of scaling to 20MB. We even didn’t intend to scale to 8MB blocksize. After the Beijing conference, Bitcoin XT distorted our intention by saying that our roadmap is to scale from 8MB to 8GB size. Many mining pools felt they were betrayed.\\n\\nI don’t think that anyone should be required to conform to the 2015 Beijing Mining Pool Consensus. If it’s a must for everyone to conform to it, then BU should not have gained any support since we just need to scale to 8MB.\\n\\n\\nFor 2016 Hong Kong consensus, it was actually the response to Bitcoin Classic. Bitcoin Classics misled us by saying that all people were supportive of them. Actually everyone at that time believed other people all support Bitcoin Classics so it turned out all people were for Bitcoin Classics. In was in the context that we held that Hong Kong Conference. The consensus stated that Core would write hard-fork codes. So many people thought it was an agreement between BTCC and Core. But actually the consensus was a response for Bitcoin Classic. There were 5 Core members at the site and they signed the consensus. But Bitcoin Core is neither a company nor an organization. It’s only some individuals and companies who support the development of Bitcoin Core. No one can compel Bitcoin Core to do anything and Core will not compel others to do anything. either. This is just the feature of bitcoin. Bitcoin is alive. It’s not a company which can post something on its official site. Likely, Bitcoin Core’s software will not update automatically. (Apple and Microsoft will send you a new version and you have to update). The update of Bitcoin Core is out of your free choices and you can also downgrade the system.\\n\\nIn fact, there are others things in Hong Kong consensus that have not been followed like Core hasn’t completed the development of SW in time. But this just proved their prudence. They will not accept a SW without thorough and sound tests. We have made some mistakes during the Hong Kong Consensus period. We were not familiar with the development of bitcoins. We have kept on learning and improving these years.\\n\\nActually Core team indeed has written the hard-fork codes which are published in BIP draft. To seem please find:\\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-February/012377.html\\nhttps://petertodd.org/2016/hardforks-after-the-segwit-blocksize-increase\\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-February/012342.html\\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-December/013332.html\\n\\nIn the conference in San Francisco this summer, Core has displayed these codes but the community didn’t give many responses. Core members are trying their best to write code and the process is continuing. They can’t compel the Core to publish the hard-fork publicly as it requires the consensus within the whole Core members. There is no leader in Core.\\n\\nCore also release 0.13, a version without SW for those who wants the most updated technique but are not willing to use SW. This version contains the most updated techniques like Schnorr signing.\\n\\nQ: Does BTCC have any contingency plan for any bug which has been discussed on reddit?\\n\\n\\nReddit is only a platform for people to share news or discuss anything. The so-called bug discussed on /r/btc are only the random guess by those who do not know technical stuff.\\n\\nIf you really want to discuss bug issues of SW, please subscribe Bitcoin Core’s email and go to their IRC chatting room. That’s where bug issue should be discussed effectively. Core has all of the communication records of Slack, IRC and subscription list published on the internet, though people won’t go there and see. People like to go to reddit. Reddit is not for technical discussion. It’s for…catfight. These so-called bugs have already been discussed between core members. It is because of these discussions of bugs’ elimination and tests that SW has come out later than expected, Core wants to provide reliable and bug-free codes to support its 11 billion USD worth industry of bitcoin.\\n\\nNow we look at BU, it hasn’t had many test reports. Actually Core has reported bugs of BU and BU didn’t give any response.\\n\\nActivity of BU on GitHub\\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ElZ71vv.jpg)\\n\\n\\nActivity of Core\\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/XbNGUqz.jpg)\\n \\nCore has done many tests and they even found bugs of library used by C++.\\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/507145d78595e052ce13368e122f72c85093992c\\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9229\\n\\n\\n\\nQ: Dose BTTC support that 1M blocksize should remain so permanently or believe it should be scaled at a proper time in the future? \\n \\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/P1duZTn.png)\\n\\nIt is a misunderstanding commonly seen in Chinese community that Core wants the block size to remain 1MB forever.\\n\\n\\n Core’s road map is just hard fork. But optimization should proceed the hard-fork. Core never said they will hold IMB block size permanently. We don’t want a block with only 1MB size, either. But If bitcoin doesn’t possess the feature of decentralization, then bitcoin is useless. It would be something like a database. Thus the smaller the blocksize is, the better bitcoin is as everyone can run it. You can’t just take care of yourself. A hard disk may be extremely expensive for the poor people. Since those who boast bigger size do not represent all the community, what we could do is to lower the threshold as possibly as we can.\\n\\nMany people may never involve themselves in Ethereum community. We wanted to run our ETC mining pool but we have encountered many problems only because the block size is too big. You can’t only envision inserting the blocksize in a disk without considering communication, synchronization and orphanage rate. Scaling is not that easy. What many people do not understand is that scaling shouldn’t be done without due consideration. If we put all the date from google and YouTube in everyone’s computer like ledgers of blockchain, then to double the data of Google and YouTube means to double the data of everyone. This will lead to an increasing pressure of the whole network. You have to pay the price for scaling. Those who think the costs are nothing for them simply can not represent everyone.\\n\\nSW indeed will scale the blocksize and Core team have some techniques for omptimization like the Schnorr signing. Schnorr can compress the transactions of 16MB into a 1MB block under perfect condition. Now the theoretical size is to compress 4MB data into a 1MB blocksize. There are many other methods to make 1MB size block size handle more data. But if needed, we can scale the blocksize into 2MB.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdded: Core team is highly transparent. All their meetings are available on the internet. See https://bitcoincore.org/en/meetings/\\n\\nQ:\\tHas BTCC Pool’s support of SW gained understanding and support from miners in your pool? In another way, has BTCC pool explained pros and cons of various options? Any relevant explanatory information can be shared to other pools for reference?\\n\\n\\n\\nA: we have a professional management team for mining pools and we have maintained active communication with them. Last week I just went to Chengdu of Sichuan Province to meet miners there. We have explained the benefits of SW to the miners of Chengdu and they expressed their supportive attitude. BTCC indeed will explain to our miners the pros and cons of different scaling plans. In the meantime, we also provide reference documents on our Weibo and Wechat to miners, traders and bitcoins fans. We invited one Lightening founder to Shanghai for a meeting with friends in Shanghai. Next week (11th NOV), We will also invite some Core members to be in Shanghai to discuss SW with friends present. We have provided the information of Bitcoin, SW and scaling plans to not only miners and but all users of BTCC. \\n\\n\\nQ: Has BTCC pool done extensive test on 0.13.1 SegWit code? Can you release test report?\\n\\nA: Sure. Thorough tests need to be done. In early April 2016, Core has contacted China’s miners including BTCC, F2Pool, AntPool BW to test SW on SegNet; In later April our pool has mined the blocks containing SW transactions; In May, mining pools including BW all completed the tests of SegNet and they have mined SW block; in October, BTCC began to test Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 and the improvements of 0.13.1 has begun since; 18th Oct, the vote of SW officially kicks off. Sorry I don’t have test files for you. But till now, judging from the mining pool’s operation, everything is fine. \\n\\nThe AMA is conducted in Chinese.\\n\\nKnowing that this AMA really matters for the both Chinese and Western community to know the ideas and thoughts of others, we have tried our best to keep the original meaning and tones in plain English. \\n\\nTo see the original Chinese AMA text,\\n\\nPlease first sign in on news.8btc.com , the international site of 8tbc, and then go directly to the thread:\\n \\nhttp://8btc.com/thread-42814-1-1.html\\n\\nTune In http://news.8btc.com/ for more fist hand information on CN community.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

They just don't agree on the best way, at a technical level, to achieve it.\\n\\nOne side believes that scaling bitcoin to support exponentially more users and transactions should happen on secondary layers; keeping the base blockchain as thin and secure as possible.\\n\\nThe other side believes that scaling bitcoin, exponentially or linearly, should happen on-chain; at least in the short term if not the long term.\\n\\nThe point to remember here is that everyone wants the same thing, they just don't agree on the best technical solution to get there.\\n\\nBy design, if the community cannot agree as a whole what direction the bitcoin software should take, then nothing changes.\\n\\nThis is the state we find ourselves in now, and that's just fine.  This is simply bitcoin acting, as it is designed to act, when there is no overwhelming consensus.\\n\\nSo, there is no point in name calling.  There is no point in personal attacks. There is no benefit in getting angry or upset about it.  This is just how bitcoin is designed to function. \\n\\nIf it were easy to shove through changes to the software in the face of extreme disagreement in the community, that would put bitcoin at a major risk of being destroyed. \\n\\nThis current state that bitcoin is in is not a sign of failure, but rather a sign of it's greatest strength. \\n\\nFor now, we are in a stalemate.  Neither side has enough consensus to enable any change.  Everyone has heard the same debates and arguments so many times, it seems doubtful many people are going to change their minds or that a true majority consensus is going to be reached any time soon.\\n\\nWe must realize that this is not bitcoin 'failing', this is bitcoin succeeding.  Bitcoin must be extremely resistant to political change.  Only overwhelming consensus within the community as a whole should produce a new version of the software.\\n\\nWe do not have that consensus today.  It is a likely scenario we will never have that consensus.  And, if that happens, then that's ok.  Bitcoin will continue to function.  It will continue to process transactions.  It will continue to be traded on exchanges.  People will continue to use it when and where it best makes sense for them.  Off-chain solutions, be they centralized or not, will still occur; though perhaps not as elegantly as would be possible if certain features were deployed.\\n\\nAt this point there doesn't appear to be much each side can do to convince the other.  At a recent conference of bitcoin thought leaders, more than 90% raised their hand when asked if they supported getting segwit activated as soon as possible.  Meanwhile, a minority group continues to lobby actively against segwit, even though the feature provides significant on-scaling in the immediate short term. \\n\\nWe may well stay in a stalemate for a very long time, years, if not permanently.  While segwit certainly makes some layer-2 technologies easier to implement, layer-2 solutions will still be developed and deployed even without it.   \\n\\nMaybe, eventually, segwit will be activated and deployed.  Perhaps the reference client will switch development teams and deploy on-chain scaling solutions. Either of these things are possible, but neither will occur unless the community converges to an agreement on one solution.  In the meantime, the fact that it isn't changing in the face of a split community is not something to get upset about, it's something to celebrate.\\n\",\n",

When it is time to publish a transaction, the transaction and routing information is encrypted in layers before publishing to the first hop.\\n\\n3. Layers are peeled off by each hop until the transaction arrives at an exit node. Intermediate nodes can only see the prior hop IP address and after they decrypt their layer can see the next hop IP address.\\n\\n4. Final routing instructions accompany the transaction, like to broadcast the transaction to the bitcoin network.\\n\\n5. Periodic messages could be sent to thwart traffic analysis.

In fact, routing information could include requests to hold the message for a period of time to confuse observers attempting traffic analysis.\\n* Using Tor can attract surveillance.

Peers download and run the ATR client\\n\\n2. When it is time to publish a transaction, the ATR client encrypts the transaction and forwards it to another ATR via tor.\\n\\n3. The second ATR decrypts the transaction and publishes it to the bitcoin network.\\n\\n**Main Motivation**\\n\\nSome have argued that [running a full bitcoin node over tor is not a good idea](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.6079.pdf) However, there is one part of using Bitcoin that it is definitely good to use over tor. When you broadcast a transaction to the network, it should not be from an IP address that can be associated with your identity. An attacker can use this information to help determine which transactions you are signing.\\n\\nSending your transaction to an ATR results in your transaction getting published without resulting in your IP address being known. Even the ATR you use cannot determine your IP address because you connect to it over tor.\\n\\n**Other Thoughts**\\n\\n* Your transaction message could be sent with a delay request to make traffic analysis harder. For example, your client could be configured to request a delay somewhere between 5 minutes and 1 hour. Each transaction you send would contain a request to delay broadcast for a random period in that range.\\n\\n* Your transaction message could be sent with forwarding instructions other than broadcast. For example, you could request that your transaction be sent directly to miners who support segwit. This offers the people who create transactions the ability to economically influence the activation of any soft fork.\\n\\n* Each ATR would have an associated .onion url that you could send transactions to over tor. Every ATR would maintain a directory of \"reliable\" ATR urls. Reliability could be scored based on comparing actual delay time before the transaction appeared on the bitcoin network to the reqested delay time.\\n\\n* This idea was visited 2 years ago by /u/laanwj and he published a basic script for submitting a transaction to a foreign node for broadcast is [here](https://github.com/laanwj/bitcoin-submittx) The behavior described in this post would be nice to have as part of Bitcoin Core, but since version 0.11 there is enough configuration and API available to do it as a separate application.\\n\\n* Similar functionality is found in joinmarket here: https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket/pull/662',\n",

Im extremely ignorant with all the talks and debates about segwit and how bitcoin is going to scale. I got into bitcoin from listening to Andreas talk about it with such confidence and one of the main things I saw potential in was his idea of micro transactions. Being able to pay fractions of a penny as tips, or per/minute viewing ect. With people posting about 24 hour ques till their transaction gets confirmed once, and the solution to this being to increase the fee, it seems like its near impossible for micro transactions to work in its current state. Is there any hope for micro transactions in the future or are we past that in terms of size. Sure, 15 cents to transfer 2 million dollars is awesome, but not a single person I know or probably ever will know will ever need to send that much money.

The Mempool holds 2279 txs waiting for confirmation. All is looking fine, and after yesterday's peak I expect my transactions to be mined in the next block.  \\n\\nScreen cap 2: http://i.imgur.com/Y3AFuUi.png  \\n\\nblock 451528 has been mined since 3s leaving 792 txs in the Mempool. Miners have started working on block 451529 and I expect them to pick up the the leftovers in the Mempool and confirm my transactions, but....  \\n\\nScreen cap 3: http://i.imgur.com/o0onJB4.png  \\n\\nblock 451529 is mined one minute later with ~1750 txs leaving 217 txs in the Mempool and still no confirmation for my transactions! Bitfury has just added a ~1000txs out of the blue to fill the block. I'm starting to get pissed off...  \\n\\nScreen cap 4: http://i.imgur.com/lVwUXfR.png  \\n\\nAt block 451532, antpool mines a small block with 1000txs only, refusing to pick up the txs left in the Mempool. I now see that bitcoin mining is a mafia type scam that can charge whatever they please to process a transaction whether by filling blocks with fake transactions or simply refusing to fill the blocks.  \\n\\nIt's obvious to me that any increase in blocksize will not change what's going on and I also doubt Segwit will help. Mining has become far to centralized and there is no more competition between pools who have reached an agreement to screw us all. Time for me to move on and quit HODLING.

It is easy to become part of the problem if you dwell in the past and what might have been. I like to think I was constructive at all stages, and that's basically the best you can do - try to be part of the solution and dont hold grudges, assume good faith etc.\\n\\nA hard-fork under contentious circumstances is just asking for a negative outcome IMO and forcing things by network or hashrate attack is will not be well received either - no one wants a monopoly to bully them, even if the monopoly is right! The point is the method not the effect - behaving in a mutually disrespectful or forceful way will lead to problems - and this should be predictable by imagining how you would feel about it yourself.\\n\\nPersonally I think some of the fork proposals that Johnson Lau and some of the earlier ones form Luke are quite interesting and Bitcoin could maybe do one of those at a later stage once segwit has activated and schnorr aggregation given us more on-chain throughput, and lightning network running for micropayments and some retail, plus better network transmission like weak blocks or other proposals.

Screwing up Bitcoin itself would be mutually dumb squabbling and killing the goose that laid the golden egg for no particular reason. Whether you think you are in the technical right, or are purer at divining the true meaning of satoshi quotes is not really relevant - we need to work within what is mutually acceptable and incremental steps IMO.\\n\\nWe have an enormous about of technical innovations taking effect at present with segwit improving a big checklist of things https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/ and lightning with more scale for retail and micropayments, network compression, FIBRE, schnorr signature aggregation, plus more investors, ETF activity on the horizon, and geopolitical events which are bullish for digital gold as a hedge.

       "  'Seg-wit is an opt-in soft-fork to miners, they can signal and protect users without supporting.  It probably is the case that there are people who do not understand this subtle point, so I wanted to flag it.  Non-segwit blocks remain valid after activation of segwit, though a miner should protect their node using a segwit aware border node, or upgrade their node but tweak it not to yet create segwit blocks until they get comfortable with it.  And unlike previous soft-forks, segwit is more miner opt-in forgivving and wont penalise via block invalidity people who do not switch their block version after activation, and there is protection provided by other miners: even if a minority of miners dont upgrade nor border node protect their infrastructure and continue mining without defences, their blocks remain valid they just are exposed to someone wasting $13k to make an invalid segwit block (or similarly an invalid non-segwit block with the non-witness part of a segwit transaction in it), which they might temporarily build on until the majority orphans or rejects it, as other miners and ecosystems economic full nodes would be validating.\\n\\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5uf6am/charlie_lee_people_dont_realize_what_segwit_is/ddusuhm/\\n\\nIn addition seg-wit transactions themselves are opt-in and provide unilateral scaling to people who adopt (there is a long list of services and wallets etc that are ready https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_adoption/) and adoption also creates capacity for everyone by logically (but not physically) moving the witness (signatures) out of the 1MB block. (Physically segwit blocks are just larger blocks https://twitter.com/lopp/status/830129625196068865 it is only old nodes that have an alternate serialisation sent to them)\\n\\nThere is a list of segwit benefits https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/ and costs/risks https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/10/28/segwit-costs/ for a fuller discussion, just wanted to highlight that segwit is 3x opt-in. First 1) the ecosystem has decide if it wants it as a pragmatic tested incremental step to scaling (seems to be the case by organic node count, ecosystem support and readiness https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_adoption/ ) where-upon  miners then should signal readiness (which is different from support) to allow those who want to opt-in to do so, and then 2) post activation it is opt-in for miners whether they generate segwit blocks (or wait a while to decide) and 3) it is up to users and services whether they upgrade and benefit directly from the scale (which benefits others via increased free space).\\n\\nFinally there is some dangling confusion about \"discounts\" or \"economic changes\".  Whether you call it a discount or an economic change, it is an unequivocal good that the perverse incentives to create UTXO bloat are reduced.  Today it is literally cheaper for a wallet to split one coin into change vs spend change from two coins which reduces UTXO impact.  UTXO is a scaling factor, it needs fast access (cache, memory) and accesses to it scales non-linearly, latency to it has been getting worse as use grows.  Artificially bloating it helps no one.  That the bloat is not worse is in part due to mildly altruistic or non-short-term cost-optimal change selection in wallets.  The weight construction in segwit is technically necessary anyway to get scale without introducing a 2d optimisation problem, and reduces the incentive to bloat UTXO hurting scalability.  So for people who look at that economically, the way to do so is that it is a beneficial reduction in a negative economic externality.\\n\\nedit: add soft-fork security explanation from https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5uf6am/charlie_lee_people_dont_realize_what_segwit_is/ddutt8x/\\n\\nA non-upgraded node will not see segwit transactions until they are included in a block, because they are non-standard, but valid (once mined) so they are not relayed to non-segwit nodes, nor between them (not locally accepted even if injected direct to node) and only appear skipping to 1-conf once a block is confirmed.

The statistics in the network today of non-soft-fork upgraded nodes are not great, so it\\'s not a new problem, all soft-forks are equal basically for this kind of attack.  The attack costs $13k to make an invalid block whether that is segwit post activation, or a CSV or even CLTV to people running old nodes.\\nHowever even people who have upgraded are vulnerable to finney attack, double-spend etc at costs of $13k and below.  So in general for high value transactions people should run uptodate fullnodes, or SPV wallets that cross check an uptodate and semi-trusted fullnode with p2p fullnodes and wait a few confirmations\\n\\nedit2: add second invalid block type noted by u/greatwolf.',\n",

BU supporters seem to think SegWit is favorable, but only as a hard fork - an argument that I don\\'t think is smart and is quite frankly disingenuous.  If anything it seems they simply object to it because Core developers designed and implemented it (the responsible way IMO, as a soft-fork).\\n\\nWhy does [Andrew Stone largely dismiss the desire for segwit integration into BU](https://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/epicenter-166-g-andrew-stone-andrew-clifford-bitcoin-unlimited)? He claims there\\'s too much \"technical debt\" w/ SegWit @~ 52 minutes into the interview; example given is a ridiculous cop-out.  He also claims \"if we\\'re going to do a hardfork anyway, why not take SegWit and make it into a hard fork?\" as an argument against Core\\'s implementation, yet his software is the software that is actually set to hard-fork, yet he hasn\\'t ported SegWit in to activate when/if his miner-controlled blocksize hard-fork activates!  At least he encourages everyone that\\'s not a sock-puppet and can demonstrate that to register on their forum to propose any changes they want to BU which will be voted up or down by the members.  Whether your membership will be rejected outright if you have voiced any pro-core opinions or not is an open question.\\n\\nOn to Ver.  Why has Roger Ver chosen a demonstrably anti-segwit approach (despite his politically safe, but practically meaningless rhetoric about not blocking SegWit), even though I have yet to find a single retail/wallet/actual-nonminer-btc-adoption-entity that is against the SegWit approach?  It enables so many pro-fungibility features in the future that it seems to me to be a no-brainer to activate.  My suspicion about Ver is that he\\'s hedging his bets with massive investments in altcoins with better anonymity features anyway, such as ZCash, Monero and DASH, so even if Bitcoin fails or falters due to fungibility issues, his anon-coin investments will offset his BTC losses.\\n\\nWhat do you think?',\n",

       "  'This posted today form ShaolinFry in Bitcointalk forum and dev list and i think is a great proposal for segwit activation  \\nWas very wrong decision to put miners in this central position for network upgrades.    \\nHere is the post from **ShaolinFry** :\\n  \\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1805060.0  \\n  \\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-February/013643.html  \\n  \\n>Some thoughts about the activation mechanism for soft forks. In the past we used IsSuperMajority and currently use BIP9 as soft fork activation methods, where a supermajority of hashrate triggers nodes to begin enforcing new rules. Hashrate based activation is convenient because it is the simplest and most straightforward process. While convenient there are a number limitations with this method.  \\n>\\nFirstly, it requires trusting the hash power will validate after activation. The BIP66 soft fork was a case where 95% of the hashrate was signaling readiness but in reality about half was not actually validating the upgraded rules and mined upon an invalid block by mistake[1].  \\n>Secondly, miner signalling has a natural veto which allows a small percentage of hashrate to veto node activation of the upgrade for everyone. To date, soft forks have taken advantage of the relatively centralised mining landscape where there are relatively few mining pools building valid blocks; as we move towards more hashrate decentralization, it\\'s likely that we will suffer more and more from \"upgrade inertia\" which will veto most upgrades.  \\n>Upgrade inertia in inevitable for widely deployed software and can be seen for example, with Microsoft Windows. At the time of writing 5.72% of all Microsoft Windows installations are still running Windows XP, despite mainstream support ending in 2009 and being superseded by 4 software generations, Vista, 7, 8 and 10.  \\n>\\nThirdly, the signaling methodology is widely misinterpreted to mean the hash power is voting on a proposal and it seems difficult to correct this misunderstanding in the wider community. The hash powers\\' role is to select valid transactions, and to extend the blockchain with valid blocks. Fully validating economic nodes ensure that blocks are valid. Nodes therefore define validity according to the software they run, but miners decide what already valid transactions gets included in the block chain.  \\n>\\nAs such, soft forks rules are actually always enforced by the nodes, not the miners. Miners of course can opt-out by simply not including transactions that use the new soft fork feature, but they cannot produce blocks that are invalid to the soft fork. The P2SH soft fork is a good example of this, where non-upgraded miners would see P2SH as spendable without a signature and consider them valid. If such an transaction were to be included in a block, the block would be invalid and the miner would lose the block reward and fees.  \\n>So-called \"censorship\" soft forks do not require nodes to opt in, because >51% of the hash power already have the ability to orphan blocks that contain transactions they have blacklisted. Since this is not a change in validity, nodes will accept the censored block chain automatically.  \\n>The fourth problem with supermajority hash power signaling is it draws unnecessary attention to miners which can become unnecessarily political. Already misunderstood as a vote, miners may feel pressure to \"make a decision\" on behalf of the community: who is and isn\\'t signalling becomes a huge public focus and may put pressures onto miners they are unprepared for. Some miners may not be in a position to upgrade, or may prefer not to participate in the soft fork which is their right. However, that miner may now become a lone reason that vetoes activation for everyone, where the soft fork is an opt-in feature! This situation seems to be against the voluntary nature of the Bitcoin system where participation at all levels is voluntary and kept honest by well balanced incentives.  \\n>Since miners already have the protocol level right to select whatever transaction they prefer (and not mine those they don\\'t), it would be better if a miner could chose to not participate in triggering activation of something they won\\'t use, but, without being a veto to the process (and all the ire they may have to experience as a consequence).  \\n>The alternative discussed here is \"flag day activation\" where nodes begin enforcement at a predetermined time in the future. This method needs a longer lead time than a hash power based activation trigger, but offers a number of advantages and perhaps provides a better tradeoff.  \\n>Soft forks are still entirely optional to use post activation. For example, with P2SH, many participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem still do not use P2SH. Only 11% of bitcoins[2] are stored in P2SH addresses at the time of writing. Miners are free to not mine P2SH transactions, however, the incentives are such that miners should still validate transactions so they don\\'t accidentally include invalid transactions and cause their block to be rejected. As an additional safety measure for well designed soft forks, relay policy rules prevent non-standard and invalid transactions from being relayed and mined by default; a miner would have to purposefully mine an invalid transaction, which is against their own economic interest.  \\n>Since the incentives of the Bitcoin system rely on self validation, economic nodes (miners and users) should always remain safe by ensuring their nodes either validate the current rules, or, they can place their network behind a full node that will filter out invalid transactions and blocks at the edge of their network (so called firewall or border nodes).  \\n>A user activated soft fork is permissive. Miners do not have to produce new version blocks and non-upgraded miners\\' blocks will not be orphaned as was the case with IsSuperMajority soft forks (e.g. BIP34, BIP66, BIP65-CLTV) which made it a compulsory upgrade for miners.  \\n>BIP9 \"versionbits\" soft fork activation method is also permissive in so far as non-upgraded miners are not forced to upgrade after activation because their blocks wont be orphaned. A recent case was the \"CSV\" soft fork that activated BIP68, BIP112 and BIP113. As such, the CSV soft fork allows non-upgraded miners to continue mining so long as they didn\\'t produce invalid blocks.  \\n>Miners always retain discretion on which transactions to mine. However, regardless of whether they actively include transactions using the new soft fork feature, or not, the incentive for hash power to upgrade in order to validate is strong: if they do not, they could be vulnerable to a rogue miner willing to waste 12.5BTC to create an invalid block, which may cause non-validating miners to build on an invalid chain similar to the BIP66 incident. Validation has always had a strong requirement.  \\n>A user activated soft fork is win-win because it adds an option that some people want that does not detract from other peoples\\' enjoyment. Even if only 10% of users ever wanted a feature, so long as the benefit outweighed the technical risks, it would not be rational to deny others the ability to opt-in.  \\n>My suggestion is to have the best of both worlds. Since a user activated soft fork needs a relatively long lead time before activation, we can combine with BIP9 to give the option of a faster hash power coordinated activation or activation by flag day, whichever is the sooner. In both cases, we can leverage the warning systems in BIP9. The change is relatively simple, adding an activation-time parameter which will transition the BIP9 state to LOCKED_IN before the end of the BIP9 deployment timeout.  \\n>You can find the proposal here https://gist.github.com/shaolinfry/0f7d1fd22743bb966da0c0b1682ea2ab\\n>References:  \\n>[1]: https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2015-07-04-spv-mining  \\n> [2]: http://p2sh.info/dashboard/db/p2sh-statistics?from=1472043312917&to=1488030912918  \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I\\'m sick of hearing this \"fail at logic\" argument over and over that I  think it deserves its own answer. I wrote this quickly and it might not be 100% accurate concerning some private infos but it gives a good idea of the reality. Please link to this post if you see FUD related to this topic in the future.\\n\\nLet\\'s talk about VC investing. Most Bitcoin companies (Circle, Coinbase, Blockchain.info, all ex-casino Chinese exchanges etc) will lose money for their VC. That\\'s the nature of the business and this is exacerbated in the space because most of these guys invested in the middle of a \"blockchain investing bubble\" without understanding Bitcoin that well.\\n\\nBlockstream is a little bit different, and is maybe more akin to company like Chain which also raised dozens (hundreds?) of millions and where the real product is not a consumer website unlike these others I have cited but a TEAM that can produce blockchains (lols) and consulting. Basically, Blockstream gathered the best Bitcoin minds in the world and they can sell their services for consulting, private blockchain projects, Bitcoin sidechains (For smart customers, so must not be too many) and so on. Remember that the people who started Blockstream were either Bitcoin devs in the first place or people who have worked in related fields from the 1990s, dreaming of a digital currency before Bitcoin even existed. Their main goal was to fund Bitcoin development and to make sure that money supporting these man hours of dev would be channeled into Bitcoin rather than wasted on various altcoins.\\n\\nWill VC investors in Blockstream make their money back ? Probably not, like most other Bitcoin/blockchain companies and who cares ? What did they want in exchange for their money ? Make more money, keep informed on the field (why most banks and financial institutions are invested in all of these Bitcoin companies, just in case it\\'s really the \"next big thing\"), and other random goals depending on who invested. Because all these Bitcoin companies have not one but many investors, each with different goals. Some investor know more or less what they are doing: Let\\'s say Barry Silbert fund that supports Bitcoin companies in the hope to make money but also keeping in mind they can recoup through Bitcoin price increase, that\\'s also how other early angels like /u/MemoryDealers were investing. And some others (banks) have just too much money to waste and their own internal politics dynamics. Also keep in mind that things are bit more complicated than \"I put some money in your company and I own your ass\". Google invested in Uber and now they are suing them for copying their self-driving technology.\\n\\nOne of the leading investor in Blockstream is Reid Hoffman founder of Linkedin, who explained clearly in a blogpost that his bet on Blocksteam was not a regular VC play, that he was hoping it would emulate Mozilla \\'s foundation model. At that time, nobody, including all these previous companies I have mentionned that raised hundred of millions, were funding Bitcoin development. So some smart BITCOIN HOLDERS with vision like Reid put money on the table to fund Bitcoin development through Blockstream with -I GUESS- the hope that the company could be sort of self sustaining through consulting/side projects. Instead of say wasting his bitcoins on the Bitcoin foundation.\\n\\nNOW concerning the company that all the crazies on r/btc keep mentioning as the illuminati/bilderberg/rotschild/freemason/whatever secret organization: AXA. It\\'s a FRENCH insurance company. Like most other financial companies, they have a lot of money to invest, can afford to spread their \"bets\", they are big slow bureaucracies, that don\\'t necessarily know what they are doing and are mostly concerned with internal politics. So you will have some random guy inside the company that will try to advance his career by betting on a new technology, the guy over him will approve the investment because he keep hearing about the new buzzword in the financial press, board meetings or at good society cocktails. And so on. I can guarantee you that the CEO of AXA has no idea what \"blockstream\" is doing. Better than that, most people in these companies don\\'t know what Bitcoin is exactly and or even care about it. This is the reality. How do I know it ? I know people (Bitcoiners) who work for these multinational banks and insurers on \"blockchains\". Conversation goes like this \"we need to do something blockchain\" \"I want the best expert, can we hire this guy VITALIK BUTERIN? or \"X\"...\" No Bank CEO wakes up in the morning thinking \"How am I going to destroy Bitcoin today?\". \\n\\nOfcourse after Kodak, Blockbuster and so on, these guys are a bit more scared of disruption like everyone else. But mostly they are overconfident and way too slow to move like every incumbents. Most of them think Bitcoin would fail by itself or will stay small and is no danger at all. And if they really wanted to take a hit at us, their solution would be to go whine to the government and pay for lobbyists that will draft anti-bitcoin legislation. But truth be told, we are decades away from being a threat to these people. Some will also throw a few prayers investments and why not hope to be a winner if the new technology really pans out by puting some money in buzzwords that pass by. Why not? But they don\\'t lose sleep over this. Worst case scenario, they will have cashed their fat checks and stock options by a longtime when the bell rings.',\n",

       "  'This is how I came to understand my position on the blocksize debate. Try to hear me out.\\n\\nSegwit and lightning will let bitcoin scale massively long term, but not increasing the blocksize at all will ultimately (even with huge fees) leave miners with limited income once they rely on fees totally, as there is a limit to how much people will pay for transactions and there is a limit to how many transactions fit in a block. This will also cause problems when trying to close payment channels due to high fees and congestion. Who will pay the $100 to close the payment channel? And what if its unconfirmed etc?\\n\\nBU is also wrong in that its naieve to think bitcoin will work with absolutely everything happening on chain. Scaling will be dependant on technology improvments which isnt going to work short term. Plus bigger blocks mean that fewer and fewer full nodes will operate risking decentralisation. (I want to be walking around with a full node on my smart watch one day soon)\\n\\nSo the solution resides in the ability to keep blocks small, build off chain scaling solutions, while also allowing miners to derive their income from fees in the future. But how do you keep blocks small and allow miners to derive their income from fees at the same time? \\n\\nThe WRONG answer is to create $10 to $100 transaction fees in that limited space.\\n\\nThe right answer is to make more transactions fit in each block. And that is accomplished by making each transaction take up less and less space in a block.\\n\\nSo its one thing to develop off-chain solutions but even more important than that is to develop on-chain scaling solutions. Segwit is a step in the right direction. Core are making strides in both off-chain solutions and more importantly developing ways to fit more transactions on-chain without increasing the blocksize.\\n\\nThe end goal is to find a way to fit millions of low-fee (10-20 cent) transactions on-chain in each block for those who need recording on the blockchain without increasing the blocksize. While also developing off chain solutions for instant, free and private transactions. This way we keep decentralisation with small blocks, users get LN, and miners get fees for income.\\n\\nBU wants this by increasing the blocksize, at the risk of making it harder to run a node. Core wants this by making transactions take up less space, at the risk of short term congestion.\\n\\nBoth are a problem and its hard to take sides. Once the blockchain gets bigger and harder to propogate it cant be made smaller, and once a user gets put off because of high fees and constantly unconfirmed transactions they might not be coming back.\\n\\nIt would be amazing if we could implement something like mimble wimble for on-chain transactions. Where all transactions in a block are recorded into one final transaction per block, but the miners still recieve the fees from all individual transactions that make up that one final transaction. making on-chain scaling a non-issue.\\n\\nBut I digress,\\n\\nWhats important now is a short term solution that does not increase the block size and also does not congest the network. \\n\\nThat short term solution is segwit. But its not enough to get us by until we get LN. So why not do segwit with a 2mb block size. That would effectively create 4 to 8 more mbs of space in each block giving us time to implement LN and not risking decentralisation of full nodes!.\\n\\nPlease for the love of all things holy. Just compromise on this one tiny thing.\\n\\nI do not want to be watching CNBC with idiots screaming \"look, now theres 2 bitcoins haha, see its a joke, how could it possibly work if the currency can just split all of a sudden doubling the amount of bitcoin\".. its idiodic and uninformed, i know, but that is what will happen!',\n",

I think we all want bitcoin to scale to everyone in the world and we just differ about the right technical way to get there.  \\n\\nHowever, there is a reality here.\\n\\nThere are two major kinds of bitcoin users.  People who treat bitcoin as an investment/commodity/digital-gold-like asset and the people who want to use it as a payment network.\\n\\nThe thing to understand here is that the people who want to use bitcoin as an investment vehicle, for it's unique properties as a currency (21 million coins, fixed inflation schedule, etc. etc) do not need on-chain scaling.\\n\\nFrankly, most of the people will **prefer** 3rd party custodial accounts.  They are going to want to use Etrade, Fidelity, Schwabb over meeting some stranger at localbitcoins or otherwise navigating the backwaters of trying to acquire bitcoin in the real world.\\n\\nIf an ETF launches, and I realize that is a really big if, it will allow bitcion to scale to many tens of millions of new users over night.  Sure, they will all be on 3rd party custodial accounts but, frankly, these people will prefer that.  They will feel far safer having their COIN shares sitting on an exchange they are familiar with, with all of their existing trading tools.\\n\\nThe point here is that the investor class does not need any on-chain scaling, including segwit.\\n\\nIf someone wants to pay $10 to perform an actual on-chain transaction to control their own personal wealth, they will happily do so.  (A good example here is the difference between buying physical gold and paper gold.  There's a huge price premium to buy and sell actual physical gold; which is why almost no one does it any more).\\n\\nWhat segwit offers is a way to get some on-chain scaling today and, most importantly, accelerate layer-2 technologies which in theory all true bitcoiners really care about and want to see happen.\\n\\nBut, it's important to note.  It's not needed for this use case. \\n\\nIf segwit never activates and the network continues to function exactly as it does today, with the same transaction capacity, the digital-gold use case is not blocked.  Also, federated sidechains, which obviously are not fully decentralized but at least limit custodial control, can and do still work, as they are working today.\\n\\nSo, if the on-chain scaling crowd thinks the digital-gold folks are somehow going to 'fold' at some point.  That's really not going to happen.\\n\\nSo, perhaps people just start flowing value into some alt-coin which is more focused on low-fee, low-value, fast confirmation payment transactions, maybe that's where things end up.\\n\\nEveryone likes to say bitcoin is useless if you can't use it for payments.  But it's not.  Because you can still use it for payments.  People are moving money on it all of the time; arguably with ever higher and higher fees pricing out low-value use cases; but to the digital gold crowd that's not a problem.\\n\\nPersonally, I want the best of both worlds.  I want my digital gold, and I also want my layer-2 networks.  That's what segwit offers as a path forward, but don't think that the digital-gold use case somehow 'needs' the low-fee, low-value payment network use case.\\n\\nIf wealthy people can send $10,000 around the world in 10 minutes for a couple of bucks, that's plenty functional enough for their needs.\",\n",

One in Montreal and the other in Hong Kong.\\n\\nAfter Hong Kong, an email was written to the bitcoin developer mailing list. It became the unofficial manifesto of the pro-Core side in the scalability debate.\\n\\nThis \"Core Scalability Roadmap\" is well worth a read: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.html\\n\\n18 months on, it\\'s interesting to see how much of it has happened.\\n\\nLibsecp256k1 has been added to bitcoin and provided a 7x speed up for initial blockchain synchronization. Pruning has been added, which allows a full node to be used without storing the entire blockchain. A number of options for limiting traffic have been added which makes it easier to use a full node on a bandwidth-constrained computer. OP_CLTV and OP_CSV have been added to bitcoin as soft forks. Lightning exists now on the testnet in alpha, it allows instant bitcoin transactions that are much cheaper and more private.\\n\\nThe major feature missing is segregated witness, which increases the block size as a soft fork along with [several other features](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/). The way soft forks work right now is that miners have a veto on them, and it seems many miners don\\'t want to take either side in the scalability debate. So nothing happens. Which is understandable in a sense that miners didn\\'t ask to be political entities, their job was only ever to set the history and ordering of bitcoin transactions. There are some new thoughts about *user-activated-soft-fork* which could activate soft forks without all this politics that miners have to keep up with, although the idea is still in the early stages.\\n\\nBack when the scalability debate started the bitcoin price was about $250, as I write today it\\'s nearing $1280; higher than it\\'s ever been.

This is purely a thought exercise.**\\n\\nA UASF for segwit can only cause a chain fork if a miner decides to include a transaction that is considered invalid to segwit miners (e.g. include a segwit input in a transaction that doesn't have appropriate signatures). This can only happen if it's willfully done by the miner by modifying their software to accept a particular type of non-standard transaction. If this occurs, the idea is that a attacking miner will be on a chain with worthless coins to economically important nodes (exchange nodes, other miner nodes, hodler nodes) and will either have to continue the attack at cost to them or come back into consensus.\\n\\nThat's all background for my shower thought: Implement a UASF in a significant amount of nodes with an automatic PoW change if an invalid (to the UASF implementing node) higher work chain fork > X depth exists. You get a interesting little game set up:\\n\\n* Miner does not actively attack UASF consensus. Nothing happens - segwit nodes and miners are still in consensus with non-segwit nodes and miners. This is the preferred option.\\n* Miner attacks UASF nodes and miners. If they are majority hashrate, they will extend the chain faster than the minority can. The attacker chain (on average) will grow faster than the UASF chain and overtake it, which would prompt the UASF nodes to automatically deploy a POW change. Unfortunately, this means almost certainly the miners that were supporting the UASF nodes will go back to mining the majority chain (they have no other option to remain economically viable) which would lead to a chain fork.\\n\\nIt provides some interesting things to think through. I'm not a huge fan of UASF because there's some incentive problems and I think (haven't thought it completely through) that it eliminates some future options in how to handle secret/malicious soft-forks. Still, it's a very interesting idea and it would be nice to study it more before dismissing it outright.\\n\\n(I was literally in the shower while I thought of this so it's probably got some obvious holes in it).\",\n",

It will however pass and will be looked back upon as insignificant IMO. In 2 years from now, to most of the people here currently it will be a distant memory, and to all the people that join us after this it will not even be a memory.\\n\\nHaving said that, this is a little wishlist of sorts coming from a macro point of view. I disregard the short term noise and focus on a larger time frame simply because at the end of the day most of this short term noise will be forgotten.\\n\\nWhat we want to see:\\n\\n1) A large group of high quality developers that, even if misunderstood due to technical misinformation, is so diversified, large, capable and transparent that we can trust they are taking the appropriate course of action for bitcoin.\\n\\n2) Bitcoin wallets that offer a choice. Send a private anonymous transaction for free with instant confirmation (small purchases). OR, pay a fee and wait 10 minutes for your data to be recorded forever in the public blockchain (large purchases). We dont care how it is achieved as long as it is achieved.\\n\\n3) A self balancing system that dynamically keeps on-chain fee prices relatively constant by keeping the supply and demand equation of block space in equilibrium. No wild swings in the price of fees, and no set/imposed fee price (it should be driven by the people paying the fees). It should be a system in which there is never congestion or backlog or delays or wildly fluctuating fee prices. At the same time it shouldnt be free either as miners will need an income at some point in the distant future. Again we dont care how this is achieved as long as it is achieved.\\n\\nThats it.

A constant 1mb limit with \"on-chain\" scaling solutions like segwit does not eliminate wild fluctuations in fee prices as future on-chain solutions are guaranteed to not always be adopted just at the right time as we hit the blocksize limit. Similarly an unlimited blocksize brings with it risks that do not belong in bitcoin. This issue must have a better longer term solution, as both raising the blocksize and fitting more transactions into 1mb blocks BOTH do not solve this issue, they both kick the can down the road without an ultimate fix. \\n\\nWe dont need much but what would be nice to see is a potential solution to ultimately fixing the blockspace/fee conundrum once and for all, not just moving the problem into the future. If core could show some ideas regarding how this will get fixed for the long term instead of the short term then there would be no community divide right now IMO.\\n\\nTLDR; segwit and LN are amazing, but they kick the can down the road when it comes to scaling.

Or both complement each other? I mean, at first glance users seem more important as miners would just mine something no one would use. On the other hand, users would be using a chain more susceptible to attacks as hashrate would be weak.\\n\\nSo imagine, Segwit for example, actually gets the majority of nodes support. A high percentage. But most miners, want to mine BU. Assume this eventually forks. What would make more sense? Answers might be biased so imagine the opposite: BU has most nodes yet segwit biggest percentage of miners.\\n\\nI assume the most valuable chain would be the \"main\" one. So miners would be mining something and would have no one to buy into. On the opposite, the other version, although less secure, would have more users buying into and an ecosystem with a more solid infrastructure. \\n\\nSo in the end is all a matter of, which chain can get the opposite faction back. I might be biased but it would seem that the miners getting users back seems harder. As they would have no services to use. On the other hand, if the other chain has more users, less miners (which means the difficulty is less and chain more insecure), making the profit margins higher. So this version seems more likely to get the miner faction back. As their margins would be bigger and we assume miners work for profit and has more users which in theory implies more demand, which consequently would mean higher price. So they can mine in a less competitive chain with users willing to pay more.\\n\\nEventually the difficulty of both chains would even out, meaning both could potentially have the same hashrate. Now between a chain with hashrate X and more users and another one with the same hashrate and less users, new users who cause demand, would be more likely to join the chain with more users and services.\\n\\n\\nI mean security depends on miners, but miners are dependent on demand. And users are the ones who create demand, meaning eventually that chain would be the most secure, eventually.\\n\\nThis is all based on speculations, assumptions, most likely naive thoughts and would probably take a long time to play out, while both chains would obviously take a hit, but, does it make sense? I would love to see why the other chain would get the users back instead of the opposite like I said.\\n\\nOther things to consider could be, finding a way to increase the security of the chain even with less miners (changing the mining algorithm?), cutting off the bad apples immediately? I know this is controversial (we don\\'t have the need to do it atm and I think it won\\'t scale to something like that)  but assume BU mining power starts to increase a lot? Wouldn\\'t it be easier to cut it off as soon as possible and fork, than later on when we have a bigger infrastructure, where the consequences would be bigger? Kinda like cancer.

They rightly say this would be open to sybil attacks and therefore is unsafe.\\n\\nThat is incorrect. UASF does not rely on counting nodes or any other sybil-able metric. Take the example of the full node belonging to BitGo. They provide wallet services to big exchanges like Kraken and Bitstamp. Their full node wallet is **far more** important to the [economic majority](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Economic_majority) than some node doing nothing running on rented hardware. BitGo's full node probably isn't even visible on the network for security reasons. So it would be really dumb to rely on p2p node counting, which is why nobody has even suggested it.\\n\\nThe real way we can figure out what the economic majority wants is simply by asking them. There is already this page (https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_adoption/) which lists more than 100 projects and businesses that are ready and willing for the BIP9 segwit soft fork. They include names like localbitcoins, coinbase.com and the already-mentioned BitGo, they form a huge part of the economic majority. After the technical details of UASF are discussed more, probably what will happen these busnesses will simply be asked whether they are willing to enforce the UASF for segwit, and if so, a new version of the full node software can be released.\\n\\nNote that businesses are being hit by the recent rise in miner fees. Projects generally receive lots of small payments which requires large and expensive transactions to combine together, so they pay more in miner fees proportionally than individual users. So businesses have a strong incentive to increase efficiency somehow, hard forking is too unsafe so the only thing available right now is segwit.\",\n",

       "  'One side wishes to ensure that the stakeholder to the ledger can run a full-node and not be dependent upon intermediaries in terms of accessing the network. This is what makes bitcoin users “sovereign”. Before bitcoin, it was previously not possible to have the management of one’s accounts under the control of the stakeholder. In terms of maintaining this relationship, scaling solutions will need to focus on net-deferred settlement models and these needs to be developed in the near term. Longer term, there may be a need for a hard fork, but should one happen, it needs to be well thought-out (wish-list), considered (avoid negative impacts), and focus on ensuring that the average stakeholder can participate without intermediaries.\\n\\nOn the other side of the debate we have Jihan Wu, seemingly in control of some 70% of all hashing power. From his point of view, having built a large mining infrastructure, he would prefer if Core increased the blocksize to facilitate on-chain scaling. As bitcoin grows and transactions increasingly happen on-chain, given space, Jihan business can develop into near monopoly as the networks confirmation processor, and as nodes become increasingly onerous to operate many further opportunities will become available to him. From a business perspective where the value of ones hashingpower exceeds that of ones ledger holding, it makes perfect sense. Bitcoin is growing up and the thought of such a controlling and central role should not be discarded lightly. We should respect this.\\n\\nNow in terms of how the situation is playing out, as far as I’m aware, the Core developers are not in contact with Jihan, and even if they were, Jihan would have an easier time herding cats. Meanwhile, Jihan, wanting to secure on-chain scaling will block the tools for off-chain scaling to occur in isolation. Moreover, his impatience is now reaching a level where alternative protocol implementations are being considered. In response, a community member has anonymously submitted a proposal for user activation of the tools required for off-chain scaling, which is not without risks, as it will provide a cause belli for Jihan to trigger a hard fork.\\n\\nAt this point, all gloves are off. Current estimations are that 25% of existing hashing power will stay with the “Core chain” and that Jihan’s 75% will start mining blocks which can be larger than 1Mb in size. In terms of when this will be triggered, we can assume that it will play out right after a difficulty adjustment so that it will require at least 8-10 weeks until the difficulty can adjust on the Core chain, granted, this assumes that the 25% signalling for segwit actually stay with the Core chain for the duration, which is by no means certain. Meanwhile, Jihan will spam the Core-chain with transaction volumes sufficient in size to grind the network to a halt. Jihan needs to kill the minority hash power Core chain in order for his chain to come out on top as the economic majority would likely follow the Core chain if they had a choice. Exchanges will find themselves in a difficult situation but will likely quickly adjust and offer trading in both coins. Savvy traders will transfer both their coins (yes, there will be two) to exchanges and sell them both, hoping to catch bids valued at more than half of current levels so as to wait out any uncertainty, however, don’t expect there to be many bids at even 50% of current market prices for either of the coins. Declines of 70-90% in each coin are to be expected. Expect major insiders associated with Jihan to divest themselves of their bitcoin holdings ahead of any such actions. Should they prove “victorious”, the current Core contributors will likely not find development as interesting. The victory will likely be Pyrrhic, but the network will increasingly become his to control over time.\\n\\nCountermeasures available to withstand such a coordinated attack include an on-the-fly hard fork difficulty adjustment / algorithm change, however I’m not sure anything has been developed or that Core contributors are even contemplating countermeasures (at least not publicly). Hopes lie in that non-Jihan hashpower stays with the Core chain and that exchanges and service providers delay recognition of the forked coins and that they won’t have value. Nobody knows, and in a panic, anything can happen.\\n\\nAs far as I can tell, Core is biding its time and hoping Jihan comes around and activates segwit. This would of course be a most desirable outcome; however unlikely it seems at this stage. Further complicating matters is that the hard fork he wishes to have implemented, should it take place, will likely require a few years to agree upon, and a few years thereafter before it can be safely activated, which, I suspect, for Jihan, is untenable.\\n',\n",

This person is followed by all of them, including Jihan WU on twitter and is often participating in the \"debate\" so I\\'m inclined to believe him.\\n\\nAlthough most of his first arguments are just different variants of critiques against Core, I tried to get the bottom of it and I\\'m pretty sure I found it.\\n\\nAfter hours of discussion, his main argument was that was that we need to scale bitcoin to \"billions\". So when I pointed out that to do that we need both increase in blocksize + onchain optimization AND layer2 scaling via smartcontracts (Such as lightning and others), he finally conceded that their group is just paying lipservice to offchain but that they think that (without being able to explain why) smartcontracts were diminishing the value of Bitcoin as money. This seems to coincide well with the fact that Roger Ver describes fixing malleability as a \"non-urgent\" problem. They see both fixing malleability and the new weighting of transactions in segwit as enabling of smartcontracts vs the simple use of Bitcoin as \"dumb digital money\" that according to them would make it more valuable.\\n\\nSo there you have it: Bitcoin Unlimited exists to block segwit. So If you find yourself not wanting to choose \"camps\", don\\'t expect any compromise such as BU+Segwit from Bitcoin Unlimited side. That\\'s the only reason for Bitcoin Unlimited existence in the first place. And If you want to support Bitcoin Unlimited, remember that there will be no malleability fix, no enhanced smart contracts, no enhanced fungibility. That\\'s the price to pay for the mining pools to support bigger blocks via BU.\\n\\nIt seems that these pools might be afraid of competition of layer 2 smartcontracts such as lightning AND they also fear segwit will enable privacy enhancements as explained by Huang shiliang on 8btc a few months ago. As you can see here:\\n\\n- http://news.8btc.com/bitcoin-community-is-withering-it-has-lost-the-excellent-circle \\n- http://news.8btc.com/be-firmly-and-openly-against-segewit-and-lightning \\n\\nHuang Shiliang is sponsored by an anonymous doner (I\\'d bet Jihan Wu) to write theses anti-segwit, anti-lightning, anti-privacy articles.

We can see that kind of defective reasoning through the proposals from the their organization-- a strong assumption that all miners will be \"honest\" all the time for whatever arbitrarily strong definition of honest is required to make their proposal make logical sense.  This is why BU proposes to effectively let miners control the network\\'s rule-- not just blocksize, but a majority of hashpower can override signature validation in BU too.\\n\\nBut Bitcoin was never designed to blindly trust miners: From day zero, described in the whitepaper and built into  the system Satoshi released, all network nodes impose virtually every rule of the system autonomously, without trusting miners-- the whitepaper even describes a mechanism for lite clients to join in this enforcement (though due to other design short comings it isn\\'t yet workable).\\n\\nIn Bitcoin miners are only trusted to order transactions and make the chain immutable; and because of these strong constraints the avenues for abuse are limited and hard to profit from. So, BU has it backwards: We don\\'t trust miners because they\\'re honest, they\\'re generally honest because the system provides very little opportunity for them to not be. This isn\\'t an insult to miners: the constrains protect them by making it less attractive to compromise them in order to compromise Bitcoin. Being trusted can be a really significant cost that people are wise to avoid.\\n\\nThe history of security is full of the corpses of systems that assumed all the users would follow their rules or made handwaving assumptions about what motivated their participants. Bitcoin was specifically designed to provide cryptographic security-- \"secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to [compromise], no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.\"-- and to the greatest extent possible, as far as we know so far, Bitcoin achieves this.\\n\\nIt pains me to see people arguing to turn it into something much weaker on the basis of confusion (or worse). I have many times seen people confusing hashpower-- a self selecting pay-to-vote-- for democracy, and I\\'ve seen people being deluded into thinking that democracy is superior to autonomy, when *at best* democracy is the least awful option when autonomy and true personal freedom are not realistically possible. The major lesson of Bitcoin-- just like that of strong encryption before it-- is that autonomy is possible in many things where few suspected it was before, including in almost every aspect of the operation of the money we choose to use. We shouldn\\'t let this kind of confusion go silently uncontested.\\n\\nYesterday a miner mined some blocks with malleated transactions. They were able to do this because the rules of the Bitcoin system, as imposed today, do not prevent it. This has been somewhat disruptive for some users-- less than in the past because many client applications were hardened during the prior malleation incidents, and many -- but not all-- use cases can be made malleation indifferent. I\\'m glad they\\'ve apparently stopped but it is up to all of us to make Bitcoin strong enough that we\\'re not depending on the total cooperation of every anonymous self-selecting party in the world to avoid disruption.\\n\\nBy providing a concrete disproof of the claims that segwit solves a non-problem this miner has in a sense done us a favor. Point taken, I hope. It also, no doubt, disrupted some of the long-chain spam attackers.  But that isn\\'t much consolation to everyone who knew there were issues already and suffered disruption due to it. \\n\\n[Measurements show](http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/services.html) 78% of Bitcoin nodes are segwit ready. Segwit\\'s design was finished a year ago, followed by months of intense testing and review.  If segwit had been active this kind of event would have been a rapid non-issue-- malleation vulnerable users could simply use segwit, and would likely have been using it for that and its other benefits.\\n\\nBU does have one point: Bitcoin does continue to work in the presence of malleation. If malleation never were fixed, Bitcoin would would still be awesome. But it\\'s better with it fixed, and it can be fixed in a completely compatible and non-disruptive way that does not risk confiscating users\\' assets, splitting the network, or otherwise causing significant disruption or harm to any user. \\n\\nThe developers in the Bitcoin project have done their part: We created an complete and total fix to third party malleation that anyone who cares can choose to use, once the network has activated it. I believe its something that no earnest and well informed participant in Bitcoin has reason to oppose. We also have a partial fix for legacy transactions implemented and queued up behind it.\\n\\nIf you\\'re waiting on us to lead the charge to push SW through, please don\\'t:  Bitcoin can\\'t afford a widespread belief that _anyone_ controls the system. The savvy among us know that no one does, but the general public has a hard time believing anything doesn\\'t have a \"CEO\" and malicious parties have exploited that incredulity to handicap developer ability to advocate: if we vigorously advocate and are successful it supports their claims that we\\'re in control.  That outcome has costs both personally and for the system which are too high, the status quo is preferable.\\n\\n(The pain here is especially acute to me, because of the vicious conspiracy theories and threats that I\\'m subjected to when I speak up about practically anything.)\\n\\nI think all the contributors in the Bitcoin project are willing and eager to provide whatever explanatory air cover or technical support is needed to get SW turned on in the network. But the heavy lifting to get this addition to the system going to need to come from all of us: think of it as an investment. The more Bitcoin can advance through the widest collaboration, the less it depends on advocacy by charismatic authorities for improvement, and the stronger it will be against adverse changes now and into the future.\\n',\n",

Thanks a lot for the serious discussion!!!**\\n**Please have a look at the explanation from cacheson in this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5z8gvq/why_i_think_user_activated_segwit_deserves_to_be/dewpivn/**\\n\\nIt took me a while to realize that \"hash power activated soft forks\" are a smart technical solution (because of the signaling mechanism), but in the case of SegWit they lead to a deadlock, where users can only watch from the sideline. So if the miners can\\'t find a consensus/compromise, it\\'s time for the users to step in. And the solution is not to buy hash power to make that decision. User activated soft forks are a bit tricky and bear some risks, but it\\'s better than waiting for another two years until the miners come to an agreement.\\n\\nAfter investing quite a few hours to fully understand this proposal (https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5z0dvr/flag_day_activation_for_segwit_deployment/), I think it\\'s not so bad. I\\'m not a developer and not a miner, just a regular Bitcoin user. Here\\'s my understanding of the UASF approach:\\n\\n~~1. No miner will be forced to activate SegWit, everybody can make their own choice.~~\\n\\n~~2. If there\\'s a sufficient majority among the nodes (economically relevant), who would accept blocks containing SegWit transactions as being valid, it\\'s worth to just activate it. This does not mean, that those nodes are forced or committed to only accept SegWit transactions in the future. Since it\\'s a soft fork, they could (and probably would) still accept non-SegWit transactions.~~\\n\\n~~3. Then it\\'s up to every user, if they would like to use the new features of SegWit WHEN RECEIVING their coins via the new SegWit transaction format or continue using the current one. WHEN SPENDING their coins, it\\'s also up to every user if he would do it via a SegWit or non-SegWit transaction, if the recipient accepts both formats. It\\'s like when shopping online, some websites only accept PayPal, some only credit card and many support both. It\\'s up to the user to make this choice.~~\\n\\n~~4. It would be neither a hard-fork nor a network split. A traditional (non-SegWit) transaction would be considered valid by both BU and SegWit nodes. This means that also a block consisting only of traditional transactions would be valid for both BU and SegWit nodes. And a block with some (or all) SegWit transactions would also be valid in both BU and SegWit nodes, the only difference is that \"the value\" (the money) of the SegWit transactions would be kind of \"lost\" from the perspective of a BU node. But it are the users (sender and recipient) who make this decision that this transaction only continues to have value in the SegWit part of the network. A BU miner/node should not care what users do with their money. The BU miner/node didn\\'t create that block, so it\\'s not their money that is \"lost\". A BU miner should only avoid to pick transactions having those \"anyone can spend transactions\" as an input, because there\\'s the risk that they create a block that is later-on considered \"invalid\" by the SegWit nodes, so they produced something which doesn\\'t make it into the main chain. But if all BU nodes agree on completely ignoring those transactions, then no harm is caused. Neither to them nor to the network.~~\\n\\n~~5. As soon as the first SegWit transactions pile up in the network, there would also be (hopefully) enough miners willing to include them in blocks, although not every miner would do that. BU miners would probably just ignore those transactions and only pick non-SegWit transactions instead when mining blocks. SegWit miners would probably not even care if they process SegWit or non-SegWit transactions and pick those with the highest fees.~~\\n\\n~~So all in all, no harm will be caused to anybody if the users decide to activate SegWit. It\\'s just the users who have more choice afterwards on how they want to SPEND and RECEIVE their bitcoins. The only problem is, that there\\'s (currently) no signaling mechanism in place for full nodes to tell the rest of the network they would from now on consider SegWit transactions as valid. So the only risk is, that the first users start creating SegWit transactions, but not enough miners are out there willing to include them in new blocks. So those users would wait for their SegWit transactions to be confirmed, but this doesn\\'t happen. Therefore it makes sense to ask the economy first, if they want SegWit transactions or not, so everybody who is considering RECEIVING SegWit transactions has some sort of guarantee that there will be other users (e.g. exchanges) who see a future value in those SegWit transactions.~~\\n\\n~~We should only give the BU miners enough time to update their software, so they avoid picking transactions with those \"anyone can spend\" inputs. But I think BU has at least one developer who can do this little change for them. And for Core miners who don\\'t want to upgrade to SegWit, I think a 0.12.x update can be provided, that also avoids picking those crazy \"anyone can spend\" transaction inputs. I don\\'t think the \"anyone can spend transaction\" (SegWit transaction) itself is a problem to the network, only if such a transaction is used as an input for another transaction again, and picked by a miner who doesn\\'t understand that this is a SegWit transaction. But as said, miners could simply ignore and avoid picking those transactions when mining blocks. Thats all.~~\\n\\n~~**What is the worst case to expect from UASF?**~~\\n>~~The users activate SegWit and will wait if a majority of miners follow. As long as there is no majority of hashpower backing SegWit, nobody will risk to use it in real transactions. But it\\'s at least ACTIVATED instead of WAITING FOR ACTIVATION. If that point is never reached, well then we have an activated feature nobody uses, but also no harm is caused.~~\\n\\n\\n~~I can fully understand, that no Core developer would want to implement this BIP, as this is a highly political mine field. Maybe a \"neutral\" developer who has never contributed to the \"Core\" software can step up to implement this change and only ask \"Core\" to review it that it was implemented correctly and ask them to include this in one of the next releases of core so we avoid forking the core code just because of this \"user request\". This feature should also not be enabled by default, but every user using the Core software has to explicitly configure/enable it on their end if he/she want\\'s to support the UASF.~~\\n\\nCheers and peace!',\n",

Regardless, I counted the number of *contributors* who had more than 3 commits and there was 45. So that means there are *61* developers who made 1 or 2 commits to bitcoin core 0.14.0\\n\\nThats *fucking impressive*. Im actually more stoked on the number of minor contributors than the major ones. Every single person who had a single commit is a person who has improved bitcoin by freely and publicly donating their time to helping this project. And every single person who does that *is likely to do more*. Thats how massive projects like linux get bootstrapped and bitcoin core is showing incredible decentralization in its developer structure.\\n\\nThis is *a very good thing* as it means the project is much less likely to be co-opted by centralization effects.\\n\\nAlso, git does show everything. Some people do review, some protocol design, some coding, some testing etc.\\n\\nFor example, Adam Back proposed confidential transactions and optimised it\\'s size. Then /u/nullc implemented it and optimized to make it a bit smaller, then more recently Adam made it another 24% smaller.\\n\\nGreg doing all of the implementation, with Back doing back end optimization. You can see the current (before 24% optimisation) on elementsproject.org\\n\\nAdam also proposed schnorr signatures and aggregation which once segwit activates would be added as a soft-fork making 27-41% smaller transactions and so increasing scale. This is design work that is essential to bitcoins continued progression and shows how core/blockstream is committed to improving bitcoins ability to scale on-chain.\\n\\nThis contribution towards the progress of bitcoin is invisible and unseen. \\n\\nThere\\'s a lot to be discussed about the \"invisible hands\" of bitcoin, who are plodding on over years doing major **major** work but yet it has not been utilized yet, like LN, like Thunder, like CT etc. \\n\\nPeople dont disregard the 1000\\'s of hours that goes into code review, design, etc.\\n\\nWhen its time to buy a new car are you going to go to the company that has 100 active engineers on design, safety, performance, etc, with many many lifetimes of experience combined in automative engineering? Or are you going to go to \"Tom Z\\'s Auto\" where they have no past work posted, no resources, no public testing, no peer review and who [make major rookie mistakes that puts the entire network at jeopardy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5zdkv3/bitcoin_unlimited_remote_exploit_crash/).\\n\\nWhen you look at **all** of the facts, and compare, you can see which *team* you should trust more with the safety and continued security of bitcoin.\\n',\n",

They seem to perceive the \"user activated soft fork\" (UASF) as a \"user enforced USE of SegWit\".~~\\n\\n~~But that\\'s not true the UASF request is only about to ENABLE the feature and see if that changes many miners minds and signal support for it.\\nAnd it is about to GIVE EVERY MINER ENOUGH TIME to update their software so they can DETECT INVALID/MALICIOUS SegWit transactions. It does not mean miners are forced to help mining SegWit transactions if they don\\'t want.~~\\n\\n~~Of course it is very dangerous/risky for an individual user to use SegWit transactions directly after activation, as long as there\\'s not enough hashpower supporting it. But that is a risk for the individual user, not for the network. Every reasonable user (receipient) should wait before they really use SegWit in a big valued transaction. Nobody is forcing them to do this just because SegWit is activated. Everybody can continue sticking to the current/traditional/non-SegWit transaction format. And every reasonable miner should only update their software, so that they at least can understand SegWit transactions. Nobody is forcing miners to help mining SegWit transactions just because the feature is activated. So if a malicious user/miner/attacker starts producing and mining invalid SegWit transactions before a majority of hashpower is backing it, he will just create it\\'s own faulty chain which is shorter than the main chain.~~\\n\\n~~We should trust on the **game theory whole Bitcoin is built upon**, that:~~\\n\\n~~1. Most people on Bitcoin are reasonable (selfish?) ;-)~~\\n\\n~~2. Most people will update their software before activation day, so that they can detect and reject blocks with invalid SegWit transactions~~\\n\\n~~3. Not many people will USE SegWit before a majority of miners is signaling support for it. And if so, the game theory defines this as \"stupid\" and it would only be those people\\'s loss. But it would be nobody elses problem or a problem for the network itself.~~\\n\\n~~4. (Yes, only the miners who were too lazy/stubborn to update their software until activation day could be tricked into mining on the wrong chain for some time until they realize that they are no longer on the longest chain anymore and spend a few minutes of their resource time on the wrong chain. But that\\'s their own fault, they should have had enough time to update their software to protect against this.)~~\\n\\nCheers and peace!',\n",

This second proposal allows extra business logic to be added, allowing for example, orphaning of non-signalling blocks.\\n\\nI believe one of these two proposal should move to published BIP stage. I prefer the latter. to be clear, they are generalized deployment extensions to BIP9.\\n\\nLastly, due to popular request, I drafted a [third proposal](https://gist.github.com/shaolinfry/743157b0b1ee14e1ddc95031f1057e4c) to cause the mandatory activation of the _existing_ segwit deployment that is being ignored by Chinese mining pools in particular. Under this proposal, if miners have not activated segwit by October 1st, nodes will reject non-signalling blocks (meaning they wont get paid unless they signal for segwit activation). Assuming 51% of the hashrate prefers to get paid it will cause all NODE_WITNESS nodes to activate including all versions of Bitcoin Core from 0.13.1 and above. This proposal requires exchanges in particular to run the BIP in order to create the financial incentivizes for mining pool operators to signal for segwit. I believe, for this proposal to move forward, it should progress to a published BIP because there is no way for exchanges, other economic actors as well as the technical community to even consider the proposal until there is something more concrete.

Once a vote was accomplished, the code could be updated and since we'd have a clear view of which way the community voted, we could force hard forks (possibly even some mechanism that would flag to nodes that they need to upgrade), without concern over ensuring miners like it or not, miners wouldn't have a choice other to upgrade to the new hard fork, or risk mining coins from a fork that nobody else wants.\\n\\nCaveats:\\n\\nI'm no expert, so I'm sure there's plenty of issues with my proposal that would need to be discussed, and probably quite a few points I missed, so don't assume the text above is a final proposal, but rather an initial draft.\\n\\nDiscussion points\\n\\n* What if ALL miners decide not to upgrade (ie. we'd lose all hashing power).\\n* Fairness of allowing the rich to have greater votes over the poor (though to be fair, this is how it works in shareholder votes - smaller shareholders have lesser say)\\n* How to enforce upgrades after a hard fork\",\n",

Historically, us big blockers wanted something that could be future-proof so we didn't have to visit the issue again, but that time is over now.\\n\\n  If core developers would be willing to eat some crow (same with us big blockers) , go public and try and mend some fences, and push for something like, say, a 2mb block increase ON TOP of what Segwit adds, I think we could get Segwit pushed through within a month.  But we have to all be willing to swallow our pride to make this work, together.   A lot of these issues, from both sides, stem from the unwillingness to admit that anything was handled poorly.  Well guess what, this whole thing was handled like shit, from both sides, and it's time to admit that.  \\n\\nThis also means that, if both sides would be willing to compromise, we would need to ensure that both sides followed through, since in the past that hasn't necessarily happened - which also left a bitter taste in people's mouths.  \\n\\nSo, all, I believe I'm not the only one who feels that, at this time, it's compromise or die.  Maybe it's a bit hyperbolic and we aren't facing such a grave threat... But what if we are?  I for one don't want to find out the hard way.  \\n\\nI apologize for the wall of text, but after all Bitcoin has gone through, I really don't want us, the community, big and small blockers, to be the reason Bitcoin fails.  And make no mistake, if no compromise is reached and Bitcoin does fail - it is all of our faults.  Not blockstreams, not unlimited - all of our faults, together. \\n\\nSo can we please get some *real* compromise?  No more blaming the other side, but real compromise.  If this doesn't work, I don't know what, realistically, our next step can be other than pure stagnation.\",\n",

       "  \"After spending the last day to figure out WTF is happening to my investment, it boils down to this:\\n\\n1)  Core devs are pushing Segwit to fix a bunch of issues, give a slight bump to on-chain scaling, and open up second level scaling.  There is some controversy about conflicts of interest suggesting they are controlled by Blocksteam and are avoiding on-chain scaling so they can offer paid second layer solutions.  The counter argument is that on-chain scaling creates centralization, and on-chain scaling will never be able to scale to what is really needed.\\n\\n2) Led by Antminer, miners have become super powerful, well capitalized, and very centralized.  There seems to be evidence Antminer controls more mining power than most people realize.  Not happy with CORE/Segwit, they and other miners have backed BU.  Proponents claim BU won't enable unless 80% (currently ~33%) of hashing power is BU.  Opponents are worried about giving the the miners too much control over the blocksize and the competence of BU devs.\\n\\n3) Most exchanges are saying BU will only be listed if replay attacks are mitigated. BU will initially be it's own symbol (i.e. an alt) even if BU has more hashing power than Core.  At some point however, they will recognized BU as Bitcoin if it becomes the clear winner.\\n\\nMy comments:\\n\\nSegwit will not activate in it's current form because it needs 95%.  By definition, the miners must have a block size increase. As the block reward disappears, ~2000 transactions per block are not going to pay for all the security (centralized or not) we enjoy.  Miners aren't trying to destroy Bitcoin with BU (they want the BTC price to go up), but allowing BU to activate will give miners even more power.  Allowing them to set the blocksize is like giving OPEC the right to control the size of your gas tank.  Unfortunately, there is a good chance they already have the 80% needed to make it happen.  As a side-note, it is worth mentioning that most of the community (even in China) still support Core (or they just don't want a fork).\\n\\nObvious Solution:\\n\\nCore needs to get off their ass and increase the block size ASAP regardless of segwit activation.  No one reasonable expects all transactions to be on-chain, but there needs to be enough space for miners to make money as the block reward decreases.  Miners are just trying to defend their future economic interests.  If they just had a plan to increase it to say 8mb over the next 5 years, all of this would go away and the BTC price would soar.  Instead, these super smart guys will lose control of this generation's biggest financial innovation.\\n\\nedit: I've done my best to be a good Bitcoin supporter here.

       "  'Vitalik claims hard forks to be a superior moral solution. However he is very wrong.\\n\\nFirst of all there is a massive difference between bitcoin and ethereum and that is the retargeting time. Ethereum has a very fast retargeting which means that both chains can survive. With bitcoin retargeting only one chain will survive as the other one will experience extremely slow blocks, extremely congested blocks and will take forever to retarget.\\n\\nAt first sight this could be seen as a good thing. However it is a terrible thing. This is because the superficial incentive analysis that has been done so far assumes that holders will vote by selling the worse chain and buying the best chain so that the price of the worse chain will crash into the ground and that miners in consequence will mine the profitable chain.\\n\\nThis would work with fast retargeting, with current retargeting however the slower chain will be so congested it would be impossible to buy or sell anything. But much more than that is the fact that the worse chain could win, not because it has more merit but simply because it may have more hash power.\\n\\nWhy is that? The incentive for the miners to mine the most profitable chain is only true long-term and if there is proper decentralization. Clearly this is not the case at the moment. Are we really sure that the miners wouldn\\'t simply make the choice that give them more power? Won\\'t they accept to give up a few days of profits to get power long-term? The winning chain will be established in just a few days because of slow retargeting. \\n\\nThe idea that miners have some incentive to do what\\'s best for everyone is completely flawed. \\n\\nKnowing that the retargeting is slow and so the winning chain will be established extremely quickly and the other chain die very quickly to (unlike ethereum were both chains can survive) it would make perfect sense for a miner to do what give him the most power long-term than what gives him the most profit short-term.\\n\\nWe can\\'t let the miners be the only ones to vote and ignore the other stakeholders.\\n\\n**Soft fork is the democratic way to vote, because all stakeholders have to agree (wallets, exchanges, payment processors) hard forks instead are simply letting the miners decide everything.** I assume Vitalik had insured that he had the support of the miners before announcing the hard fork. Anyway seems that most ETH \"investors\" had \"invested\" in the DAO.\\n\\n**If we want to analyze incentives the only incentive I see is the incentive for Vitalik to destroy bitcoin so that ethereum can grow more. I\\'m not saying it\\'s his intention simply that he has a strong incentive to do so. Also segwit is really the biggest threat there is to ethereum as it allows smart contracts to be executed as sidechains making ethereum basically useless. I assume Vitalik cannot simply say \"big blocks\" without destroying his integrity, so he can\\'t attack segwit. He prefers to claim that soft forks are bad and hard forks are good hoping the division will help ethereum. Please note: I\\'m not attacking the guy and I really don\\'t know him personally. I\\'m just speculating what would make sense if one looks at the incentives.

One side wants to increase the block size via segwit, while the other side wants to increase via hard fork. I have strong opinions on the topic but I won’t discuss them here. The point of the matter is we are seeing the politicization of protocol level changes. The critiques of these changes are slowly moving towards critiques based on who is submitting the BIP -- not what it actually contains. This is the worst thing that can happen in a meritocracy.\\xa0\\n\\nAvoiding politicization of technical changes in the future\\n\\nI like what Tom Elvis Judor did when he submitted his MimbleWimble white paper to the technical community. He submitted it under a pseudonym, over TOR, onto a public IRC channel. No ego involved\\u200a—\\u200aonly an extremely promising paper. Tom (and Satoshi) both understood that it is only a matter of time before who they are impedes technical progress of their system.\\n\\nI propose we move to a pseudonymous BIP system where it is required for the author submit the BIP under a pseudonym. For instance, the format could be something like this:\\n\\nBIP: 1337\\n\\nAuthor:\\xa09458b7f9f76131f18823d73770e069d55beb271b@protonmail.com\\n\\nBIP content down here\\n\\nThe hash “6f3…9cd0” is just my github username, christewart, concatenated with some entropy, in this case these bytes: 639c28f610edcaf265b47b0679986d10af3360072b56f9b0b085ffbb4d4f440b\\n\\nand then hashed with RIPEMD160. I checked this morning that protonmail can support RIPEMD160 hashes as email addresses. Unfortunately it appears it cannot support SHA256 hashes.\\xa0\\n\\nThere is inconvenience added here. You need to make a new email address, you need to make a new github account to submit the BIP. I think it is worth the cost -- but am interested in what others think about this. I don't think people submitting patches to a BIP should be required to submit under a pseudonym -- only the primary author. This means only one person has to create the pseudonym. From a quick look at the BIPs list it looks like the most BIPs submitted by one person is ~10. This means they would have had to create 10 pseudonyms over 8 years -- I think this is reasonable.\\xa0\\n\\nWhat does this give us?\\n\\nThis gives us a way to avoid politicization of BIPs. This means a BIP can be proposed and examined based on it’s technical merits. This levels the playing field\\u200a—\\u200amaking the BIP process even more meritocratic than it already is.\\n\\nIf you want to claim credit for your BIP after it is accepted, you can reveal the preimage of the author hash to prove that you were the original author of the BIP. I would need to reveal my github username and “639c28f610edcaf265b47b0679986d10af3360072b56f9b0b085ffbb4d4f440b”\\n\\nThe Future\\n\\nPoliticization of bitcoin is only going to grow in the future. We need to make sure we maintain principled money instead devolving to a system where our money is based on a democratic vote\\u200a—\\u200aor the votes of a select few elites. We need to vet claims by “authority figures” whether it is Jihan Wu, Adam Back, Roger Ver, or Greg Maxwell.

I don\\'t understand why anyone would oppose that.\\n\\nHowever, I do believe that some of the concerns about any static block size are valid. Apparently reaching off-chain consensus about a hard fork is increasingly difficult and we just don\\'t know if any static block size would be sufficient for the future with so many factors uncertain (rate of bitcoin adoption, hardware/network improvements, projects utilizing the bitcoin chain for consensus, viability and availability of proposed scaling solutions and so on).\\n\\nBitcoin Unlimited proposes a solution, which, as I understand it basically allows nodes to set their block size preferences in the client and attempt to reach \"emergent consensus\" about the block size on-chain. I have two serious problems with this proposal:\\n\\n1. Every configurable setting in a node about which the network requires on-chain consensus increases chain divergence and thereby decreases the reliablity of each transaction confirmation. To minimize effects on security, reliability and confirmation time (time to a high enough probability of immutability), potentially highly contentious on-chain decisions about the protocol itself should be kept to a minimum. To achieve this, we should either use a pre-defined algorithm to dynamically change the block size based on on-chain data or even if we allow users configure their preferences, we should limit the number of choices (eg. only 3 options: double the blocksize, halve it, or keep as is) and limit the periods of potential contention in advance (eg. 1000 blocks long voting periods every 10000 blocks which define the block size for the next 10000 blocks). Continuous contention (\"emergent consensus\") between infinite possibilites just doesn\\'t seem like a good option here.\\n\\n2. The other problem is the effects of any block size increase itself to miners. Due to resources being finite and limited, some miners may have difficulties or even become completely unable to participate in block production/validation at higher block sizes. While this itself is not neccesarily a problem as hardware and network speeds can be expected to improve, we must ensure that the miners locked out this way can still participate in the voting process about the specific setting that locks them out. This wound ensure that miners that are unable to participate due to large block sizes would be heard and should they reach majority, block sizes would be lowered. This could probably be achieved by counting block size vote signals on orphan blocks with valid PoW in addition to main chain votes. This way, if some miners become unable to participate in the main chain due to the majority increasing block sizes, these miners could opt to keep producing valid PoWs (not blocks on the main chain) to signal a block size decrease at the next voting period. At the end of the voting period, nodes could count these PoW backed votes in addition to signals on the main chain to determine the block size for the next period.\\n\\nWith all that said, my goal here is really just to encourage (hopefully) constructive discussion about present proposals, the future of the protocol and find solutions to the concerns of the community. Please do chime in!',\n",

They would use it only if the fees are lower and they place value on having instant transactions.

It is clear that both coins will be dumped heavily, but mainly BU tokens as there will be little demand for them. And my problem lies here: the BU chain will quickly get attacked and taken down as BU is full of crap code, so Bitmain will have to make a choice and either Hard Fork again or switch back to the old chain. If they hard fork again, they are probably going to use the latest code written by Core. As they will be in absolute control of that fork, they could start mining with SegWit activated. My assumption is that they have planned this well and I would be more than happy if someone could correct me if I am wrong. \\n\\nJust imagine, by how much that would increase the value of 'ex BU' tokens, whose value would be near 0 in exchanges. Now there are two chains, one with and one without segwit. Which one will the miners choose to mine and what will the users do? They choose to HF in order to change the PoW algorithm and activate segwit, and/or do just a UASF, in order to take back the control from miners, something that would give birth to two additional chains. Now there are 4 chains/networks and users have to choose which one they want to use.

Let us remind ourselves that the majority are not tech savvy and do not understand how bitcoin works or how segwit works. Core devs are very talented coders and know how to make safe software. This is important when tens of billions of dollars worth of wealth and potentially future of the financial infrastructure is at stake. BU devs are not as careful and as a result have remote exploit codes in their nodes. BU if I understand correctly would also give consensus power to miners and away from nodes. This would power very centralized, especially with mining power becoming more consolidated with the new multi-petahash facility being built. It should also be apparent that BU does not seem to care about importance of decentralization by looking at the hashing power and node count of BU. BU I am against for its reckless code, deceitful behavior, and attempt to hijack public opinion of the non-tech savvy, to centralize power. No amount of \"blocksize increase\" that wont also cripple node decentralization is possible. Blocksize affects bandwidth usage and blocksize. Nodes need to download entire blockchain right now, even on pruning. Will only be matter of time until say 1 GB. blocks are not enough for blocksize. \\n\\n**We need solutions with technical foresight beyond what the mere simple sees** . The simple say \"oh lets just increase blocksize\" this will only fail in the end eventually. **Majority of people pro-BU generally lack in technical understanding.** I also am annoyed how segwit is often dragged into the supposed \"blocksize debate\". **Segwit is needed much for many reason that have nothing to do with scaling, but happens to have some scaling as side effect and creates pathway for further scaling including but not limited to Schnorr signatures and other scaling solutions that need the things that segwit fixes and enables before can be made possible.** \\n\\nIn conclusion. Segwit is not the end-all ultimate solution for scaling. We need scaling. But BU is dangerous and not the answer. And we need segwit anyways. After we get past this silly attempt to divide the community we can then work on scaling, segwit will make scaling easier.\"',\n",

He states he did not author it.**\\n\\nRecently the BU and hard fork topic has become heavily obfuscated. Both sides are sticking to their guns and the arguing has become unbearable. Everyone claims that their own ideas are line with Satoshi’s vision of decentralization, and everyone believes that the other side’s plan will lead to the perils of centralization. On the surface, it appears that all arguments are founded in idealism. But are they really? In actuality, the conflicts at hand are ultimately the result of profit seeking. The tail is wagging the dog. This fellow (referring to himself) is now going to make a couple of observations about the community’s diverging interests and analyze what the significance of those differences is.\\n\\nIn regards to the fork issue, the heart of the conflict lies with the distribution of the fees for a given transaction and whether they should be handled by the miners exclusively or if they should be spread out (to a second layer). Up until now every transaction on the Bitcoin network has been handled by the miners, and all fees have been given to miners. From the standpoint of rational self-interest, it is only natural and obvious that the mining community is satisfied with this arrangement. However, this situation is likely to be disrupted by Bitcoin developers building lightning network and side chain layer two protocols. If a second layer comes to fruition, many Bitcoin transactions will be facilitated through it, thus bypassing miners,  and ultimately resulting in them receiving less fees. It is obvious that the mining community wouldn’t be happy with this type of change.\\n\\nIf this is to be the general state of affairs, with the developers producing functions that only serve the users, then users will exercise these functionalities, and the miners will have no way of stopping it. However, the current circumstances in bitcoin are subtle. God (or perhaps Satoshi) has given the miners a blocking instrument. This ‘blocking instrument’ is the malleability loophole. This bug has inadvertently become developers’ largest obstacle in producing new functionality. By not removing this bug, developers’ second layer protocols will be hard to implement. The fix to this bug is segwit, but implementing this type of plan requires the mining community’s support.\\n\\nIn other words, transaction malleability has become the mining community’s first line of defense, a passage ((of a mountain range)) that can be guarded. Holding this point alone will strangle the development of layer 2 protocols, preventing transaction fee revenue being spread to outside of the mining community.\\n\\nRational self interest is human nature. Moreover, in order to win customer support, many layer two protocols such as the lightning network are exaggerating the functionality and benefits, and saying nothing of the limitations and shortcomings. This further exacerbates the miners’ fears. Therefore, the miners coming together to boycott segwit implementation to guard transaction malleability is the first line of defense.\\n\\nBlocking the fixing of a bug, on an emotional level as well as a logical one, is not appropriate. These miners know this in their hearts. That is why they do not bring the issue to attention and are not willing to clearly articulate their position. From their perspective, a relatively compromising strategy is to delay segwit and promote on-chain scaling.\\n\\nWhy would they promote on-chain scaling you ask? Because if the on-chain fees are kept to within a reasonable scope, the user’s attraction to second layer protocols wouldn’t be as great.\\n\\nWe can draw an example from the global oil trade. OPEC enjoyed a monopoly over global crude oil supply and was able to raise prices above 100 usd per barrel. However, this lead to the development of shale oil, breaking OPEC's monopoly. If OPEC had kept oil prices at a marginally lower level, say 50 USD per barrel, shale oil development would not have been as attractive. Now, shale oil production has become entrenched. Even if OPEC dropped prices to 30 USD per barrel, they would still be unable to destroy shale production. This has created an unfavorable situation for oil producing countries. Miners are afraid of exactly this type of phenomenon.\\n\\nIn summary. The hard fork is not an issue spawned from differing ideological points of view. Rather, it is a simple conflict of interest. The conflict cannot be resolved via slogans, propaganda, arguments of ideological correctness, fears of centralization, or fanning the flames of war amongst users. These are not paths to the solution.\\n\\nIf we want to solve the problem, we have to talk sincerely about distribution of interests (profits), and reach a compromise in the pursuit of those interests (profits). Miners shouldn't try to strangle the developers in their development of new functionality, and the developers, in designing those new functionalities, must promote defending the interests of the miners. It is the only way bitcoin can achieve its goal of reaching the moon.\",\n",

POW as a concept is the same as extracting commodities. \\n\\nMining is resource intensive. It takes electricity to mine. It takes special equipment to mine. All this cost money. It's capital intensive. Mining has concentrated in China for this reason. The rates for electricity for whatever reason is lower. But globally the average for electricity is 3x of what china prices are. \\n\\nIn the oil field this dynamic plays out in cycles. You have periods where prices are low. Storage capacity is high. The industry centralizes. Then you have periods where supply is low. Storage tanks levels drop. Prices of oil goes up. The industry decentralizes. \\n\\nBitcoin differs from this a little but it's the same principle. If we really wanted to decentralize it's not but taking prices lower. That will just centralize us more in mining. That will centralize influence on how the protocols direction will be. And miners who can persist in a low price environment will do and say whatever they can to protect there market share. They will act in their own interest to keep players out. They will keep prices in check because they know the higher prices will bring more capital out to take on risk. They know if there marketshare gets diluted then we will get segwit. We will get L2 solutions. They know Wall Street money will flow in. They know they will have competition. \\n\\nSome miners and investor will get really rich. But the goal of the market is to produce an environment where decentralization can thrive. And in my opinion we are about $9k away from the beginning of that. And every halving would have to produce 3x the price just to keep the environment decentralized. \\n\\nTo those investors, devs, miners, exchanges, users, and businesses thank you. You started something that will change the world. Let's change it. Markets give us $5k and let it persist as the low. Manufacturing mining industry will comeback.

       "  \"I'm a non-bitcoin related developer that has held an interest in the technology for a long time, but there's a couple of observations I wanted to make.\\n\\nFirst, my observation is that BU has forked their code from an ancient version of BC and have changed things including needlessly renaming variables to the point that a merge or cherrypick is literally impossible. As a result the efforts of BC, ahead by roughly 4000 commits, cannot be pulled into BU. As a result there is no real sharing of effort. The reverse is somewhat true as well.\\n\\nThis to me raises huge red flags as it means all the upstream fixes do not make it downstream and it seems to me that the tests performed by BC are far more extensive and measured than those by BU. This immediately shows a maturity in the code design to me. If I were downstream I would take advantage of all that work and just add my bits on top.\\n\\nAs a backend developer myself, I am quite used to the frontend guys rushing ahead trying to slip features through that break security or avoid proper tests and getting annoyed at me for 'holding them back'. Its my job to ensure that everyone who links to my stuff follows the rules, has full integration and unit tests. This can be aggregating to others but it results in better code. It also requires lots of stubbornness on my part. I'm sure those of you in similar positions will empathise.\\n\\nThere are a significant amount of people invested into BU for one reason or another. My fear is that whilst the intent may be good the code is not mature enough. We also have Core who have their own path, right or wrong, that many others are heavily invested in.\\n\\nWhy not have a fork of the latest BC, that merely adds the large block support in, and tracks closely to upstream. This way you have an implementation that has ALL the benefits of BC, ALL the tests and measured pace, and you can just test the bits YOU want in on top. This will greatly help BOTH sets of developers as you're looking at similar code and problems in one can be fixed in both. It means that whilst a competing fork may not agree to the same rules, the developers time on that competing fork time is NOT wasted and should the fork die at least their time looking at the same code could potentially fix or improve the other fork AND garner them experience to potentially provide support to the winning fork. If the fork wins, the same is true of the other developers.\\n\\nBy having two totally divergent forks that do not track each other we have enormous waste of work should one fork die. This I think is tragic.\\n\\nExample: BU wants large blocks and no segwit. So track BC closely, include all the code that includes segwit, add the large block support (and test this extensively) but disable signalling for segwit. Track upstream changes to segwit (but have it not signalled) just in case it wins. If it fails, then both chains can just pull it out entirely. If it wins, the losing chain just switches it on and moves to their next goal.\\n\",\n",

       "  \"**TL;DR- BU initiating their fork during a UASF attempt would help the UASF, not hurt it.**\\n\\nWhen I first read /u/shaolinfry's [User Activated Soft Fork proposal](https://gist.github.com/shaolinfry/743157b0b1ee14e1ddc95031f1057e4c), I was worried that implementing it would provide the Bitcoin Unlimited faction with an opportunity to disrupt the network by enacting their hard fork at the same time. Bitcoin would split into three different coins, there would be mass confusion and chaos, etc. I figured it would be better to wait until after the BU fork has been attempted and Bitcoin has stablized.\\n\\nThinking about it further today, I realized that such a scenario wouldn't be so dire, and would even help the UASF to succeed.\\n\\nLet's say that on October 1st, the UASF's activation date, only 20% of the network's 3500 petahash/s supports it. Another 20% (700 PH) are signalling for segwit, but not for the UASF. 50% (1750 PH) support BU, and the remaining 10% (350 PH) aren't signalling for anything. The network splits into a 700 PH UASF chain, and a 2800 PH chain with everyone else.\\n\\nThe BU supporters, seeking to capitalize on the divided network, decide that it's time to make their move. For the purposes of this thought experiment, assume that they were smart enough to implement wipeout protection to stop their chain from being orphaned if it ceases to be the most-worked chain. Now we have three chains:\\n\\n* UASF - 700 PH, ignores the other two chains\\n\\n* Non-UASF - 1050 PH, sees the shorter UASF chain, ignores the BU chain\\n\\n* BU - 1750 PH, ignores the other two chains\\n\\nThe UASF chain now has 40% of the non-BU hashrate. The non-UASF chain is in danger of being orphaned by the UASF chain if a few more miners switch over, or even just due to variance. This creates a strong incentive for everyone to abandon the non-UASF chain. If BU hadn't forked, the UASF would still only have 20% hashrate, and might be ignorable.\\n\\nI'm sure someone will object at this point that since non-UASF participants are being forced to upgrade, they'll just go ahead and switch over to BU.\\n\\nWell, what if some of them did? This would still accelerate the progress of the UASF. If the 350 PH of non-signalling miners switched to BU, the UASF and non-UASF chains would be dead-even in hashrate. As soon as a reorg happens, they'll be unified and segwit will be active. The segwit chain will have 1400 PH, 40% of the original network's hash rate. The BU chain will have 2100 PH, which is 60%. This means that Bitcoin will be in a much better position to win the fight against BU than if they had waited for 75%.\",\n",

You can click on the second column (BIP148 / Update client name to Satoshi BIP148 / etc) to see what changes were made in that version (compared to the version before it) specifically.\\n\\nScroll down until you hit\\n\\n    Showing with 19 additions and 5 deletions. \\n\\nThis is where the \\'fun\\' (programming) begins.\\n\\n#src/clientversion.cpp\\n\\n    -std::string FormatSubVersion(const std::string& name, int nClientVersion, const std::vector<std::string>& comments)\\n    +std::string FormatSubVersion(const std::string& name, int nClientVersion, const std::vector<std::string>& comments, const bool fBaseNameOnly)\\n\\nRed lines, which always start with a minus sign, means that line was removed from the file. Green lines, which always start with a + sign, mean that line was added. \"But the line wasn\\'t removed, just some stuff was added to the end!\" Correct! This is a \\'diff-ism\\'. Diff being the name of the program used to show differences between a file. Diff doesn\\'t highlight just the part of the line that changed, it highlights the entire line, and leaves it to you to spot the changes in the line. \\n\\nFrom the above, we can see a parameter was added to the end of the line. \"But what does the line do!\" Well, what you\\'re looking at is a function declaration. What is a function? Well, imagine you wanted to build a robot to make sandwiches for you. You could make the sandwich yourself, but it\\'s easier if an automated system does it for you. The function is like the robot; you put a specific set of tasks into the robot\\'s programming, give it a specific set of inputs (bread, knife, meat/cheese/spreads/etc) and it returns the resultant sandwich. The way to read the declaration is this:\\n\\n    std::string FormatSubVersion(const std::string& name, int nClientVersion, const std::vector<std::string>& comments, const bool fBaseNameOnly)\\n\\n1. **std::string** The first argument is the return type of the function. In this case, a [C++ string](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string).\\n2. **FormatSubVersion** This is the name of the function\\n3. **(const std::string& name,** the first parameter of the function, since it is unchanged from Core, and unmodified by other changes in the file, I will not bother explaining what it does.\\n4. **int nClientVersion,** Second parameter to the function. Same thing, original, unmodified, skipping.\\n5. **const std::vector<std::string>& comments,** Parameter 3, unchanged, skipping.\\n6. **, const bool fBaseNameOnly)** Parameter 4, \\'const bool\\' means two things: 1) we cannot change the value of this variable in the code. 2) it\\'s a \\'bool\\' type, which is short for boolean. It an either be true or false, those are the only values it can ever have. What does it do? Let\\'s keep reading.\\n\\n-\\n    std::ostringstream ss;\\n\\nThat\\'s important for later, make note of it.\\n\\n    if (!fBaseNameOnly)\\n        ss << \"UASF-Segwit:0.2(BIP148)/\";\\n\\nThe above is the change uses the newly minted parameter 4 to add a bit of text into the output stream. Specifically, the string \"UASF-Segwit:0.2(BIP148)/\" is tacked on to whatever is ahead of it in the output stream. The net result of this change is that clients using this code will report their client version as \\'/Santoshi:0.14.0/UASF-Segwit:0.2(BIP148)/\\' instead of the standard value of \\'/Santoshi:0.14.0/\\'.\\n\\nFile complete! Next file.\\n\\n#src/clientversion.h\\n\\nWithin C or C++ programming, you have the concept of \\'code files\\' (ending in .c or .cpp) and \\'header files\\' (ending in .h). Strictly speaking, any code can be in either file and the compiler will figure it out (assuming you give it enough information to do so). However, programming conventions exist. Since I assume the readers of this post are (largely) not programmers, I won\\'t bore you. It\\'s a convention used for sanity only, and it is a convention followed by the bitcoin source code. In general, program code that \\'does stuff\\' goes in .c and .cpp files, and the code needed to tell the compiler (compiler = the thing that converts these text files into a program) where to \\'find stuff\\' goes into .h files.\\n\\n    -std::string FormatSubVersion(const std::string& name, int nClientVersion, const std::vector<std::string>& comments);\\n    +std::string FormatSubVersion(const std::string& name, int nClientVersion, const std::vector<std::string>& comments, bool fBaseNameOnly = false);\\n\\nWell, because this is the exact same function call we just talked about in the previous section, I\\'ll skip going through the parameters one by one, and instead focus only on the change: **, bool fBaseNameOnly = false)**. \\n\\n\"WAIT! It has \\'const\\' before bool in the .cpp file! That\\'s bad right!?\" No. The compiler will see const in the .cpp file and mandate the variable be const.\\n\\n\"WAIT! Here it says \\'= false\\' and in the .cpp file it doesn\\'t!\" Again, not a problem. Remember how I said some code goes in .c/.cpp files, and some in .h files? Well, this is a case where which file contains what code actually does matter. Basically, you can\\'t set a default value for a parameter inside a .c/.cpp file. You can only do that in a .h file. So...that\\'s 100% correct. Here is the souce code for a quick little program to see this behavior:\\n\\n--test.cpp--\\n\\n    #include \"test.h\"\\n    #include <stdlib.h>\\n    #include <stdio.h>\\n\\n    int main()\\n    {\\n        function();\\n    }\\n\\n    int function(const bool tmp)\\n    {\\n        tmp = !tmp;\\n    }\\n\\n---test.h---\\n\\n    int function(bool test = false);\\n\\n--If you tried to compile this, you\\'d get--\\n\\n    g++ test.cpp\\n    test.cpp: In function ‘int function(bool)’:\\n    test.cpp:12:6: error: assignment of read-only parameter ‘tmp’\\n        tmp = !tmp;\\n\\nIn this case, \\'read only\\' means \\'was declared const\\'.\\n\\nRemember how a 4th parameter was added in the code above? Well, you have to tell the compiler to expect that parameter, which you do here, in the header file. That line of code tells the compiler to expect the 4th parameter. It also sets the default value of the parameter, should the caller not specify it, to be false.\\n\\nThus, you can call this function two ways:\\n\\n1. FormatSubVersion(\"Test\", 99900, std::vector<std::string>())\\n2. FormatSubVersion(\"Test\", 99900, std::vector<std::string>(), true)\\n\\nUsing method 1 would result in a User Agent string of \\'/Test:99900/UASF-Segwit:0.2(BIP148)/\\', because the program uses the default value of \\'false\\' and so it sticks in the bit about BIP148 support. Using method 2 would result in \\'/Test:99900/\\' \"Wait, wait, how did you figure that out?\" [Look here](https://github.com/UASF/bitcoin/blob/fc6a63d9704f4a74fb665fbadb7c7d9defd60d01/src/clientversion.cpp), scroll to the bottom (line 88) and that is the FormatSubVersion function we went over above. All you do is built the string in steps as you read the code:\\n\\n1. Line 90: \"\"\\n2. Line 91: \"/\"\\n3. Line 92: \"/Test:99900\" {the \\'Test\\' comes from the \\'name\\' parameter, parameter 1. The : is statically coded (<< \":\" <<) and the 99900 comes from nClientVersion, parameter 2}\\n4. Line 93: From the function call, we see that parameter 3 is initialized \\'std::vector<std::string>()\\', this is an empty vector. If the vector had anything in it, it would look like this: **std::vector<std::string>(\\'a\\')**\\n5. (because the if statement in line 93 fails, we go to: ) Line 101: \"/Test:99900/\"\\n6. Line 102: (are we doing a version with or without the 4th parameter set to true?)\\n7. Line 103: (if parameter 4 is false, line becomes \"/Test:99900/UASF-Segwit:0.2(BIP148)/\"\\n8. Line 104: Convert the \\'ss\\' variable to a standard C++ string and return the that string to whatever asked this function to be run.\\n\\nSO, in total, this function literally just creates a string. Much like the robot-sandwich example, you give the function a client name, version, and list of comments and it builds you a string containing those things.\\n\\n#src/test/util_tests.cpp\\n\\nThis file is part of the automated testing for bitcoind/bitcoin-qt.

Anything it does will be \\'in addition to\\' whatever is already done.

Anything after a // on a line will be part of the comment.\\n* Line 1855: [GetMedianTimePast](https://github.com/UASF/bitcoin/blob/fc6a63d9704f4a74fb665fbadb7c7d9defd60d01/src/chain.h) is defined in src/chain.h (line 295-307) and returns the average timestamp of the last 11 (or fewer) blocks. Basically, because there are more than 11 blocks in the blockchain, and assuming you aren\\'t looking at the first 10 blocks, this code will always give you the median time at which the last 11 blocks occurred. So..., let\\'s say the last 11 blocks occurred at: 100,120,140,190,210,230,240,250,270,275,290 this function would return: (11 - 0) / 2 = 5, so it would return the 6th (computers count from 0) element of that list, so 100 is the 0th element, 120 is the 1st, so it would return 230 as the \\'Mean\\' time.\\n\\n\"Ok, but what about 1501545600? How do we know that?\" It\\'s an [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) timestamp. Google \\'epoch converter\\', copy-paste that number in, convert to UTC, and you\\'ll see it is correct for what the comment says it is.\\n\\nThe \\'&&\\' at the end of the line means \\'and\\'. So in this case, \\'if the mean age of the past few blocks is greater than or equal to <date1> **and** ...\\'\\n\\n* Line 1856: \\'the mean age of the past few blocks is less than or equal to <date 2> AND...\\'\\n* Line 1857: Use\\'s Core\\'s own function to check whether the previous block (to the current one we are validating) showed Segwit in the active state (see [BIP9 state transitions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki#State_transitions)). So, at this point, the logic says: \\'if the mean age of the past few blocks is greater than or equal to <date1> AND the mean age of the past few blocks is less than or equal to <date 2> AND the previous block did NOT show segregated witness as active, then do line 1859\\'s actions (the bit inside the {}), otherwise, go to line 1865.\\n* Line 1860: This uses a [bitwise-AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) mask to determine what features the block supports. The mask is defined in [src/versionbits.h](https://github.com/UASF/bitcoin/blob/fc6a63d9704f4a74fb665fbadb7c7d9defd60d01/src/versionbits.h) Version bits are a feature of [BIP9](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/06/08/version-bits-miners-faq/) which is easily explained at a high level at that link. In essence, this if statement says \"If this block supports BIP9...\". This is hard for the non-programmer to understand by reading, so I\\'ll explain it this way: If you use the bitwise-and mask on a block with the format of a non-BIP9 block, then the result of the bitwise-and is the value of VERSIONBITS_TOP_BITS. That is why it says !=, which means \\'not equal to\\'.\\n\\nYou can see proof of this claim in the tests written in [src/test/versionbits_tests.cpp](https://github.com/UASF/bitcoin/blob/fc6a63d9704f4a74fb665fbadb7c7d9defd60d01/src/test/versionbits_tests.cpp) lines 277-281. line 277 creates an \\'old format\\' block, then (line 279) checks that the ComputeBlockVersion function works, then verifies that the bitwise-and function returns TOP_BITS, as expected.\\n\\n* Line 1861: Parses the version mask to see if the mask signals support for SEGWIT. As of this line, the inner if statement reads: \\'If this block does not support BIP9 messaging, or this block does not signal support for SEGWIT, then go to line 1862, otherwise, go to line 1863.\\n* Line 1862: Reject the block, stating that the block must support SEGWIT.\\n\\nIf you are concerned that more might be needed to reject a block, simply view [src/validation.cpp](https://github.com/UASF/bitcoin/blob/fc6a63d9704f4a74fb665fbadb7c7d9defd60d01/src/validation.cpp) on line 1892 and see that standard bitcoin Core code rejects blocks in the same way as the SEGWIT patch does.\\n\\n\"So wait, what is the total requirement to reject a block again?\"\\n\\n1. If the mean age of the past few blocks is greater than or equal to <date1> AND the mean age of the past few blocks is less than or equal to <date 2> AND the previous block did not show that Segwit was in \\'active\\' state: \\n2. If all of the conditions in step 1 are met AND the block either does not support BIP9 messaging, or does not signal support for SEGWIT\\n3. Then it will be rejected.\\n\\n\"So wait, what happens after the first segregated witness block pops across the network? Hasn\\'t that already happened?\" No. Blocks that *support* segwit have come across the network, but in order for [IsWitnessEnabled](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/90586b68972c7f7eea3dd07008d97482a42e8072/src/validation.cpp#L2892) to return \\'true\\', the SEGWIT  state would need to switch to \\'active\\' (see [BIP9 spec](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki#State_transitions)), which is the final state of any proposal, and the point at which the setting is considered an accepted part of the blockchain.\\n\\n#Conclusions\\n\\nSo, you see, no muss, no fuss.

What if the blocksize is also subject to a similar algorithm that re-targets a block cap every 2 week period, based on the average block size of the previous period? The idea would be to keep blocks at, for example, 80-90% capacity. If during the previous period, there were an x amount of blocks at 100% capacity, causing a backlog, the algo increases the maxblocksize by y amount, every so incrementally. \\n\\nOne can pose the question of how this is different from BU? As I understand it, BU does not have a hard cap on blocksize at all. Theoretically this opens the network up to certain risks, such as spam bloating certain blocks to such a size that would cause problems with nodes. My proposal still sets a maxblocksize cap, but dynamically increases (or decreases) the maxblocksize according to network demand. By retargeting the blocksize every 2 weeks, changes are incremental and averaged over a long enough period of time in order to  ignore possible \"black swan events\" that may be attacks on the network.\\n\\nI\\'ve read Satoshi Nakamoto\\'s whitepaper and I get the sense that the 1mb blocksize limit initially instituted was rather arbitrary, with the main goal to provide for enough throughput to allow the network to operate for the foreseeable future (from the point of view of someone back in 2009) while also ensuring that the blockchain doesn\\'t get so large that common folk couldn\\'t run nodes on their computers, stifling the propagation and decentralization of the network. Therefore, if we can eliminate the technical risks associated with a block increase, why not allow for a compromise and build in such algo?\\n\\nI am personally a big proponent of segwit and the many benefits it will bring to the network. LN alone is what could take bitcoin mainstream. But as a pragmatist I also realize some of the changes will not come about quickly, and it will not solve all of the issues with backlogs that will only grow worse in the foreseeable future. There is also the BU camp that will obviously refuse to budge unless a compromise is made, and without their support segwit will not activate. Therefore, I ask the technically inclined, is my proposal with dynamic re-targeting of blocksize even technically feasible, has it even been thought of by someone else already, and if so, what is the status of such proposal?\\n\\nExcuse me if I am re-inventing the wheel here, or if my proposal is completely unfeasible for reasons I do not understand yet.

It's my belief that Bitcoin has value because the economy puts faith into it, if the currency is changed in a way they don't like, businesses/exchanges/individuals will not accept this new currency, and the coins miners are mining will become worthless and they will be forced to mine the old currency if they want to earn anything.\\n\\nHowever, I have noticed that posting links here to threads on a certain Bitcoin forum causes the post to get removed.

Also, this BIP seems ignored the txid malleability of the resolution tx, as my major technical critique of xblock design.\\n\\nBut anyway, here I’m only making comments on the design. As I said in my earlier post, I consider this more as an academic topic than something really ready for production use.\\n\\n> This specification defines a method of increasing bitcoin transaction throughput without altering any existing consensus rules.\\n\\n Softforks by definition tighten consensus rules\\n\\n> There has been great debate regarding other ways of increasing transaction throughput, with no proposed consensus-layer solutions that have proven themselves to be particularly safe.\\n\\nso the authors don’t consider segwit as a consensus-layer solution to increase transaction throughput, or not think segwit is safe? But logically speaking if segwit is not safe, this BIP could only be worse. OTOH, segwit also obviously increases tx throughput, although it may not be as much as some people wish to have.\\n\\n> This specification refines many of Lau's ideas, and offers a much simpler method of tackling the value transfer issue, which, in Lau's proposal, was solved with consensus-layer UTXO selection.\\n\\nThe 2013 one is outdated.

How are they exactly arranged? I suggest it uses a root of all txids, and a root of all wtxids, and combine them as the commitment. The reason is to allow people to prune the witness data, yet still able to serve the pruned tx to light wallets. If it makes txid and wtxid as pairs, after witness pruning it still needs to store all the wtxids or it can’t reconstruct the tree\\n\\n> Outputs signal to exit the extension block if the contained script is either a minimally encoded P2PKH or P2SH script.\\n\\n**This hits the biggest question I asked in my January post: do you want to allow direct exit payment to legacy addresses? As a block reorg will almost guarantee changing txid of the resolution tx, that will permanently invalidate all the child txs based on the resolution tx. This is a significant change to the current tx model.** To fix this, you need to make exit outputs unspendable for up to 100 blocks. Doing this, however, will make legacy wallet users very confused as they do not anticipate funding being locked up for a long period of time. So you can’t let the money sent back to a legacy address directly, but sent to a new format address that only recognized by new wallet, which understands the lock up requirement. This way, however, introduces friction and some fungibility issues, and I’d expect people using cross chain atomic swap to exchange bitcoin and xbitcoin\\n\\nTo summarise, my questions are:\\n1. Is it acceptable to have massive txid malleability and transaction chain invalidation for every natural happening reorg?  Yes: the current spec is ok; No: next question (I’d say no)\\n2. Is locking up exit outputs the best way to deal with the problem? (I tried really hard to find a better solution but failed)\\n3. How long the lock-up period should be? Answer could be anywhere from 1 to 100\\n4. With a lock-up period, should it allow direct exit to legacy address? (I think it’s ok if the lock-up is short, like 1-2 block. But is that safe enough?)\\n5. Due to the fungibility issues, it may need a new name for the tokens in the ext-block\\n\\n> Verification of transactions within the extension block shall enforce all currently deployed softforks, along with an extra BIP141-like ruleset.\\n\\nI suggest to only allow push-only and OP_RETURN scriptPubKey in xblock. Especially, you don’t want to replicate the sighash bug to xblock. Also, requires scriptSig to be always empty\\n\\n> This leaves room for 7 future soft-fork upgrades to relax DoS limits.\\n\\nWhy 7? There are 16 unused witness program versions\\n\\n> Witness script hash v0 shall be worth the number of accurately counted sigops in the redeem script, multiplied by a factor of 8.\\n\\nThere is a flaw here: witness script with no sigop will be counted as 0 and have a lot free space\\n\\n> every 73 bytes in the serialized witness vector is worth 1 additional point.\\n\\nso 72 bytes is 1 point or 0 point? Maybe it should just scale everything up by 64 or 128, and make 1 witness byte = 1 point . So it won’t provide any “free space” in the block.\\n\\n> Currently defined witness programs (v0) are each worth 8 points. Unknown witness program outputs are worth 1 point. Any exiting output is always worth 8 points.\\n\\nI’d suggest to have at least 16 points for each witness v0 output, so it will make it always more expensive to create than spend UTXO. It may even provide extra “discount” if a tx has more input than output. The overall objective is to limit the UTXO growth. The ext block should be mainly for making transactions, not store of value (I’ll explain later)\\n\\n> Dust Threshold\\n\\nIn general I think it’s ok, but I’d suggest a higher threshold like 5000 satoshi. It may also combine the threshold with the output witness version, so unknown version may have a lower or no threshold. Alternatively, it may start with a high threshold and leave a backdoor softfork to reduce it.\\n\\n> Deactivation\\n\\nIt is a double-edged sword. While it is good for us to be able to discard an unused chain, it may create really bad user experience and people may even lose money. For example, people may have opened Lightning channels and they will find it not possible to close the channel. So you need to make sure people are not making time-locked tx for years, and require people to refresh their channel regularly. And have big red warning when the deactivation SF is locked in. Generally, xblock with deactivation should never be used as long-term storage of value.\\n\\n————\\nsome general comments:\\n\\n1. This BIP in current form is not compatible with BIP141. Since most nodes are already upgraded to BIP141, this BIP must not be activated unless BIP141 failed to activate. However, if the community really endorse the idea of ext block, I see no reason why we couldn’t activate BIP141 first (which could be done in 2 weeks), then work together to make ext block possible. Ext block is more complicated than segwit. If it took dozens of developers a whole year to release segwit, I don’t see how ext block could become ready for production with less time and efforts.\\n\\n2. Another reason to make this BIP compatible with BIP141 is we also need malleability fix in the main chain. As the xblock has a deactivation mechanism, it can’t be used for longterm value storage.\\n\\n3. I think the size and cost limit of the xblock should be lower at the beginning, and increases as we find it works smoothly. It could be a predefined growth curve like BIP103, or a backdoor softfork. With the current design, it leaves a massive space for miners to fill up with non-tx garbage. Also, I’d also like to see a complete SPV fraud-proof solution before the size grows bigger.\\n\\nSource: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-April/013982.html\",\n",

       "  'UASF, as explained well by shaolinfry [here](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-February/013643.html), is a scheme that basically requires overwhelming support from the userbase of Bitcoin. For this reason, even though it\\'s a soft fork, which is fundamentally safer than a hardfork, is a risky strategy. Why support it? Why not just let things lie, and accept that updating Bitcoin is hard and that isn\\'t, by any means, an unambiguously bad thing?\\n\\nThe answer at a high level, is that **miners are now fully convinced that they not only have a say in changes to Bitcoin, but the only say**. And that is a disaster.\\n\\n### Scenario:\\n2 months from now, no UASF gained any traction, miners, led by Jihan Wu, celebrate this victory and enact a new fork. It doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s a soft or hard fork, but the former are easier to do. It could be something stupid and disruptive like only allow transactions that say \"Jihan wu is great!\" in an OP_RETURN (note: SF because rule restriction, so old nodes don\\'t get kicked off the main chain; but still massively disruptive because disabling old node txs). Or more realistically it could be some kind of hard fork to move to \"emergent consensus\", where miners entirely control the size of blocks, or .. whatever. What\\'s far more important to Jihan and his crew is to establish the *precedent* - we say what the main chain is, because we have the hashpower.\\n\\nIf we\\'ve given up on any ideas of user activation, **we are completely powerless to stop it**. And that goes as much for Roger Ver as it does for Greg Maxwell, users, developers, anybody. Hash power no longer just orders transactions - it sets *all* rules, full stop. Many will say \"they won\\'t try to force a block reward increase or huge fees, they\\'d be going against their real incentives\" - of course, mostly true, at least today. But it can be much more subtle, to start with. Hashpower sets rules on covert asicboost, enabling monopoly. It sets rules that decide what kinds of transactions are allowed. Jihan may feel (and there\\'s evidence that some miners *do* feel this) that privacy-enhancing upgrades are intolerable; to stay on the right side of governments, no kinds of easy mixing tech is allowed. No second layer (which is too good for privacy) payment channels allowed. Let\\'s disable OP_CSV that\\'s \"complicated\", \"technical debt\".\\n\\n### So is anything realistic without UASF coordination, or are we doomed?\\n\\nDisabling covert asicboost does *not* disable asicboost, it only stops miners having a *secret* reason to prevent a protocol upgrade (whether they\\'ve done it or not in the past). Consider people on the fence, e.g. Brian Armstrong at Coinbase. Can he stand up in public and say \"I am against only blocking a secret usage of asicboost, which incentivises miners to block protocol updates apart from any other reason, to the tune of $100 million\"? On what planet could he say that with a straight face? And the same for any other economically important actor - even miners cannot; although, probably some will, by spouting some bullshit. For this specific case, I think we should be able to get *everyone* economically significant on board, if only they can be told the facts in a simple, straightforward way. However, if I am wrong about that, the entire Bitcoin project to me is right on the brink of failure. Bitcoin controlled by miners will be a very shitty Paypal, ultimately.\\n\\n### Counterargument - why is a \"cabal\" of \"Core\" devs any better than a cabal of miners?\\n\\nHere we come to the heart of the matter - should there be anyone in charge of changes? If so, who?\\n\\nMy first response is - no one should be able to make *any* changes, period, ideally. This is a *possible*, *ideal*, future - and at least we\\'re trending in that direction. Changes are *very* hard, and I suspect many super-bright people with slightly thin skin have been very upset about how hard it is to get consensus on their proposals (one reason for so much friction).\\n\\n\\nBut that future is not here yet, so let\\'s look at the past: Satoshi pushed changes and told the miners to upgrade, end of story. Now we have hundreds of developers, with a much smaller number having the most influence. We use an open source governance process, where people gain influence via valued contribution over a long time, and even when they have influence, there are thousands of eyes on their proposed updates.\\n\\nThis governance model isn\\'t perfect, because it involves people. It *ought* to work fine mostly for low-level technical changes. As a somewhat tech-savvy user, rather than contributor, I\\'m happy to let those who\\'ve proved themselves make the technical decisions, but with the understanding that the project has huge inertia, and that not every decision will be perfect. It\\'s hubris to think you deserve your opinion on technical topics to be heard when you haven\\'t put in the hours on the details of the code.\\n\\nSo while trivial changes to the code either don\\'t happen, or don\\'t cause contention anyway, some quite profound changes, over a period of time, still gain traction today, despite the aforementioned inertia - and segwit is by far the most important one recently, **because it fixes a bug in the design of Bitcoin**. Make no mistake, segwit is a huge deal - not because it increases the block size, that\\'s a compromise really, but because it finally fixes a bug that will allow people to write code *without* touching the consensus layer, that enables real innovation; Lightning is the standout illustration of this, but there\\'ll probably be others. Because of this bugfix nature, enabling innovation, segwit might be the *last* such big change that\\'s even needed. So in this sense, we might actually fall at the last hurdle.',\n",

SegWit has several [benefits](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/) including short term higher transaction capacity, long term much higher transaction capacity through second level transactions and also safe (!) increasing of the block size. Additionally it will make it easier for smart contracts and the like to build on Bitcoin directly. If Satoshi would design Bitcoin from scratch today he would probably do it in a similar manner.  \\n  \\n3. SegWit is a good solution, ready for action and well tested. Even some of it\\'s strongest opponents secretly admit it is \"good\" ([verified chatlogs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/67nc2r/verified_chatlogs_why_jihan_and_jiang_want_to/)).  \\n  \\n4. There are two possible ways to deploy/implement SegWit, as a softfork (SWSF) or as a hardfork (SWHF). A hardfork would allow a slightly cleaner implementation but would also require replay protection (as the exchanges have specifically asked for lately). SWSF does not require replay protection assuming a hashrate majority. Replay protection is difficult thus SWHF would altogether cause more technical debt than SWSF. Also a hardfork is generally considered of higher risk and would take longer preparation time.  \\n  \\n5. Because of a block verification processing time vulnerability that increases quadratically with block size, increasing the block size is only possible AFTER SegWit is active and only for SegWit transactions. There might be alternative solutions but these will require more computing resources and do not scale as good with larger block size.  \\n  \\n6. Any alternative to SegWit SF would take at least half a year longer in implementation and testing.  \\n  \\n7. A large mining hardware manufacturer and a rich early adopter are trying to prevent SegWit from being activated, probably because of financial incentives and/or power political reasons ([verified chatlogs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/67nc2r/verified_chatlogs_why_jihan_and_jiang_want_to/)).  \\n  \\n8.

Watching altcoins with SegWit flourish pressure from the users will become so high that Bitcoin finally will get SegWit, probably by the miners accepting SWSF after all.  \\n  \\n10.

       "  'I recently published [BIP149](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0149.mediawiki) and would like to take a few moments to explain the details of this proposal.\\n\\nBIP149 is a completely new deployment of segwit, which I propose if the current BIP9/BIP141/143/147 segwit deployment fails to lockin/activate by November 15th.\\n\\nBIP149 cannot be run on mainnet now, and there is code in the reference implementation to prevent it from running. It is incompatible with the current segwit deployment on purpose to remove unnecessary complications.\\n\\nEssentially, the idea is, if the current segwit deployment fails to activate by Nov 15th, we can release new software that has BIP149. This uses [BIP8](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0008.mediawiki) to activate segwit by July 2018. Miners will still be able to trigger activation by 95% threshold signalling as normal. In the 8 months from November to July 2018, nodes will be able to upgrade to BIP149. If segwit is not MASF activated by July 2018, there will be enough of the economy running BIP149 that nodes can begin enforcement. What will actually happen is on the first retarget after July 4th, the [BIP8](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0008.mediawiki) state machine will switch to LOCKED_IN status for two weeks, and then on the following retarget, ACTIVATION will occur. The rationale here is in 5 months we achieved 70% saturation of witness capable nodes, so by the time segwit timesout with all the urgency and demand people feel for segwit, we can expect them to upgrade at least as fast, if not much faster. I have spoken with a number of developers who think this is a reasonable assumption.\\n\\nBackground, I had hoped to be able to release a BIP that can be deployed concurrently now with segwit, but, there are various technical complications in implementing it cleanly and making it easily reviewable. I had various feedback from others in previous iterations and in order to get the widest support from developers especially concerned with predictable results and thus safety, I came to the conclusion that the BIP will get the widest support by not attempting any shortcuts and by removing all complexity. I know many people want segwit now, but, I think we should just bite the bullet and do it the BIP149 way. I already made a shortcut BIP with [BIP148](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0148.mediawiki). I will discuss the pros and cons at the end.\\n\\nBack to BIP149, this is a completely new redeployment with a new service bit NODE_UAWITNESS and new compact block protocol version - doing this avoids many gotchyas which I will explain below:\\n\\nCurrently, segwit capable nodes advertize the NODE_WITNESS service bit and preferentially peer with other NODE_WITNESS nodes. Post activation, segwit-active nodes will then know who they should relay witness blocks to and who they should relay old style stripped blocks to. The assumption is if I am a NODE_WITNESS node and segwit has activated, then other NODE_WITNESS nodes will also be segwit activated. We cannot reuse NODE_WITNESS because when BIP149 activates, they would believe non-BIP149 NODE_WITNESS nodes were also active. Using a new service bit, and effectively starting a new deployment as if the previous deployment doesnt exist, is the most predictable and trouble free way to go about it.\\n\\nAdditionally, BIP149 is compatible with existing mining software by reusing the \"segwit\" name and deployment chainparams (it\\'s not possible to have two deployments with the same name, one expired and one pending/active, due to how versionbits is implemented). In short, if the current segwit deployment fails to activate, we can reuse parts to maintain compatibility, while changing the bare minimum to remove any conflicts with old nodes. It\\'s clean, predictable and easy to review.\\n\\n**BIP148 IS NOT BIP149**\\n\\nRemember BIP148 is exceptional, it\\'s NOT what a usual UASF BIP should look like. A normal UASF if effectively activation on a predetermined date in the future (a flag day). BIP8 combines BIP9 miner signalling with a flagday if MASF does not occur.\\n\\nHow is BIP149 different to BIP148? So BIP148 is a UASF which can be used in two ways. (a) The economy can run BIP148 and basically force miners to signal for segwit, thus activating the current segwit deployment. Or, (b) a majority of miners, 60% or so, could run it and censor other miners who do not signal segwit, thus causing the current segwit to deploy. In method (a) a chain split will occur if any miners do not upgrade, and given the fact there are always absentee miners and pool operators, this is quite likely. It\\'s the economy vs hash power saying \"if you dont signal, your blocks will not be worth anything because we will reject them\". In the case of (b) you have a majority of hashpower, who could use their majority to orphan any non signalling miners. This isn\\'t great but it\\'s less disruptive than (a) because there is a majority hashpower definitely opted in.\\n\\nBIP149 on the other had does not guarantee a chain split since that could only happen if a miner deliberately takes action to manually create a segwit invalid block, which would be rejected by the economy. The incentives are different also, with BIP148 a chainsplit comes for free, regardless of if it lasts long or not. In BIP149, a miner would have to specifically take action to split and waste their money, which they could do at any time anyway. BIP149 is uncontroversial in the sense it is just a redeployment with guaranteed activation at the end, for a soft fork we are fairly sure people want and will upgrade to. The evidence is everywhere. UASFs deployed over a long time and a decent flagday are perfectly safe - all soft forks are enforced by nodes, even if activation is triggered by hashpower.\\n\\nAnyway, we\\'ve got 8 months from now to review and think about BIP149 - it cannot be deployed until November. If you would like to show support for BIP149, feel free to add the following to your `bitcoin.conf`\\n\\n    uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP149\\n\\nNote you can have multiple uacomments like:\\n\\n    uacomment=BIP8\\n    uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP149\\n    uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP148\\n\\nYou can find the bitcoin.conf file [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin#Bitcoin.conf_Configuration_File)\\n\\nYou can also just add this to a shortcut - create a shortcut (or edit the existing one you use) and add this to the end:\\n`-uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP149`\\n\\ne.g. (just add the property to the end like this):\\n\\n`\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Bitcoin\\\\bitcoin-qt.exe\" -uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP149` if you are using Windows.\\n\\nYou can also just add uacomments as multiple command line/shortcut arguments like \\n\\n    -uacomment=BIP8 -uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP149 -uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP148\\n\\nThen you can check here to see how your node is signalling at https://bitnodes.21.co/ will show something like: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8333 /Satoshi:0.14.1(UASF-SegWit-BIP149)/\\n\\nIf your node has synced and doesn\\'t show using the link above make sure to enable forwarding of port 8333 so you accept incoming connections (if you want to that is) - in your client: go into settings / network and tick enable incoming connections and use upnp.

But I think we are on a serious stalemate scenario and we might even face a no point of return situation on a possible contentious HF plus considerable altcoins innovation and traction.\\n\\n\\n**What\\'s the difference between the block size debate from years ago and today?**\\n\\nWell, it reached the limit(literally), the block size limit, backlogs, fee market, lower performance, money floating to alts. Everything that was once feared and predicted years ago are now a reality and although I think market pressure drives innovation this is another situation: we have two sides all beating up themselves claiming their each favorite ice cream flavor is better when they all like ice cream in the end, while the vendor(miner) is just doing its intended job, factoring all ice creams and seeking for profit. It\\'s a real shame to see a bunch of trolls from both sides calling each other names and this won\\'t make it any better.\\n\\nI gathered two compromise situations which we could discuss about and hopefully come with a new compromise ideas:\\n\\n\\n* **1. The Core side compromise:**\\n\\nCore has produced the most reliable bitcoin client so far, so they have a good reputation on that. Hands down. The implementation of Segwit as soft fork has its own reasons, but given the situation we are today \"they\" still haven\\'t made a public statement of a potential 2-4 MB bump of non-witness data yet. Why this? Why not give what the miners side want plus what the community wants so we can move forward to new solutions on top of bitcoin? \\n\\nA block size increase upgrade will not fail or bring any danger if both sides wants it. The centralization factor will be nothing on raising non-witness data to 2-4MB, given it\\'s clearly needed, and this will not drive to a massive centralization, it\\'s the opposite, it\\'s a necessary upgrade for the time being and potentially a good chunk from both sides will agree on that. Otherwise, if this stalemate continues, the biggest losing trade-off side that I\\'m seeing now is bitcoin losing performance, purpose and deceiving to other cryptos (even copycats like LTC) when it seems the network can raise the block to 2-4MB non-witness data pretty safely AND peacefully giving bitcoin the momentum and time it needs now. We need to calm down and be factual with it.\\n\\n\\nWould this be an old new compromise? Bitcoin Core gives a clear statement of a non-witness data 2-4 MB increase flag day, support and code + SW.\\n\\nAlthough I don\\'t think it\\'s healthy giving so much voice power to a \"single team\", you can\\'t deny a compromise like this from Core devs would refresh the community.\\n\\n\\nps.: Don\\'t come here and say segwit-only is the compromise and is a block size increase. It\\'s not anymore given we need more than that to reach a consensus from both sides. It\\'s not technical it\\'s a compromise which both sides must give away their egos to reach an agreement. Got it?\\n\\n\\n* **2. The simplest one:**\\n\\nRaise the block size to 2-4MB for god\\'s sake (I don\\'t believe in god) and give bitcoin a proper onchain capacity to buy time for any other solutions if the community thinks Segwit soft fork or BU/EC is not enough. Every newcomer \"already knows\" its 10 minute block time and will eventually know why bitcoin has a great network effect and security. Just do it.\\n\\n\\nBitcoin as for today is already successful so why does it have to under perform right now? Let bitcoin continue infighting for better scaling solutions if needed be, but don\\'t let it under perform while we have a simple and 100% compatible solution on hands. \\n\\nI personally think that Bitcoin is \"too big to fail\", but this stalemate and inaction is slowly changing not only my mind. \\n\\n\\n**Why not BU/EC?**\\n\\nEven the signalers are not running BU, aka fake signaling. So this tells us we don\\'t even have stable implementations for EC yet or to give a trust for now. I straight forward block size increase seems safer.\\n',\n",

By short term, I basically mean you want to to have a reasonable chance to lock in some minimal amount of free-and-clear revenue (denominated in btc) even if it\\'s just a few satoshis.

But this seems a bit wrong for 2 reasons, (i) using a dollar denomination hides the fact that, in btc, the fees are still very low and (ii) if you use a dollar denomination, the price will almost always 'increase' based on the fact that if the economics underlying Bitcoin are correct, the value should increase relative to the dollar. \\n\\nMore over, the greater the market grows, the higher the value of each individual bitcoin, meaning fees effectively decrease because of the deflationary effect. So essentially what I'm saying here is, the short-run effect is somewhat reducing the transactional utility of the platform, but in the long-run the market will rebalance so I don't see why this is being used as such big reason for any of the implementations of scaling.\\n\\n> on 'centralisation'\\n\\nBoth sides of this scaling debate seem to use this stick to beat the other side with; but again, I don't understand what the issue is; some 'centralisation' for lack of a better word, is inevitable with either implementation - the Bitcoin economic model necessitates it. The money involved in (even if it was just one cpu per person) running a node 24/7 incentivises people to pool together either their CPUs or their money in order to have a competitive advantage in the market - and that is perfectly fine. What most of you are calling 'centralisation' is there by design: let's call conglomeration instead. The greater the hashing power on the network, the greater the difficulty, the greater the economic incentive to band together. \\n\\nIs this a problem? That depends on your perspective; in a nascent like this where there are relatively few players, it looks like a market-failure. But if you think about it, this is just another short-run issue: the larger the pool, the greater the hashing power, but the lower the profit for each individual member. You get where I'm going with is.\\n\\n> on UASF\\n\\nI have to honest, this is the one that confuses me the most. There is no such thing as a 'user activated' soft fork. As in, the tail can't wag the dog. You either fork with the majority of the hashing power, or you don't. That's how Bitcoin was designed. It's possible to do something like a UASF on a low liquidity and low hastate Blockchain like Litecoin, but quite simply there is far too much money at stake now in Bitcoin for it to encourage anything other than the current stasis we are in. \\n\\nWhich means, if you really believe in Bitcoin, you have to be willing to compromise a little and give the miners who secure the network a >little< of what they want. Which leads me to my next point:\\n\\n> on segwit v on-chain scaling solutions \\n\\nI don't understand how this debate ever became so vitriolic. At the end of the day, this is just a technical debate about the best way to implement scaling. From my perspective: we essentially need a HF which gives some implementation of both because (i) politically now, this is the only way to resolve the issue that will placate both sides, (ii) there seems to be merit to having both. \\n\\nBoth sides are like two people attributing serious moral failings because one prefers to peel a banana from the top and one prefers to peel it from the bottom - who cares, as long as we get to eat the banana. \\n\\nI'm posting this on both r/Bitcoin and r/btc because I genuinely would like to get responses from both sides.

Transactions that had confirmed on the legacy chain will become unconfirmed (unless they are also confirmed on the BIP148 chain). Bitcoins mined by legacy miners will cease to exist, as they lose their blocks. (This cannot occur in the inverse direction: no matter how long the legacy chain gets, BIP148 nodes will never let it reorg out the BIP148 chain.)\\n\\nIf the chain splits, the BIP148 side will have Segwit activating, whereas the legacy side will remain stagnated. There is a possibility this will give a market bias in favour of the BIP148 side, even independently from its initial adoption.\\n\\n\\\\* Note that even a minority-hashrate chain can get longer than the majority-hashrate chain with some variance, although this becomes less probable with time. (On the other hand, the longer the chain split goes on, the more likely the BIP148 side grows in hashrate relative to the legacy side.)\\n\\n#Avoiding a chain split (and all the risks above)\\n\\nA chain split can be avoided entirely if a sufficient amount of the economy adopts BIP148. Miners depend on their minted bitcoins in order to pay electric costs and recoup ASIC R&D costs. If the price they can sell their legacy bitcoins drops too significantly (possibly to zero when/if their blocks get reorg\\'d out by the BIP148 chain), they will have no choice but to switch to the BIP148 chain themselves, ensuring it is the longest chain for both BIP148 and legacy nodes. If the economy shows strong enough deployment of BIP148 prior to August 1st, it is even possible miners may switch preemptively, avoiding a chain split from occurring altogether. Note that only 51% of miners need to switch to the BIP148 chain to resolve or prevent the chain split, *not* the original 95% target.\\n\\nBIP148 can also be automatically cancelled entirely by locking in Segwit before August 1st.\\n\\nSo there are a few ways a persistent chain split might be avoided:\\n\\n* 95% of hashrate locks-in segwit before August 1st. No chain split at all.\\n* 51% of hashrate deploys BIP148 before August 1st. No chain split at all.\\n* 51% of hashrate deploys BIP148 after August 1st. Chain split gets resolved.\\n* Legacy miners are compelled by the economy to switch to BIP148 after Aug 1st. Chain split gets resolved.\\n\\nBasically, everyone’s risks go down with more people running BIP148 nodes. :)\\n\\n',\n",

When a miner wants to sell his rewards, and pay for his electricity he goes to an exchange or maybe directly to an electric company to do so.   \\n\\n 2. No amount of money can decide which nodes Coinbase uses to approve bitcoin transfers from miners.   \\n\\n 3.

It\\'s a consensus protocol after all.)\\n\\nhttp://coin.dance/poli  has a good estimate of economic node support, weighted by estimates of purchasing activity.   EDIT: You have to click \"enable weighting\" to get the real results.\\n\\nYes, I know it could be a big fat lie.   But they are really good about showing references and I *personally* think they are quite accurate.  Right now UASF is at only 2% weighted support and 4% weighted opposition.  \\n\\nSure, there is no way to track the real numbers perfectly... but ultimately *miners know who their big buyers are*.   \\n\\nFinally, *if* Coinbase/Kraken/Poloniex/Bitfinex all say they support a UASF... hashpower *will follow*.  Because if they don\\'t they will go out of business.

The argument that segwit doubles the block size is besides the point because scaling the blockchain gets us nowhere.  Doubling the block size does not buy a lot of time.  Only secure, off-chain transactions (aka Layer 2 systems) can deliver on the promise of a **large scale, worldwide, decentralized, secure system of money.** And the most important aspect of SegWit is that it enables Layer 2 systems.\\n\\nMiner refusal to activate segwit, which fixes the bug that prevents effective deployment of layer 2 solutions is the primary menace holding back bitcoin and, quite frankly, holding back the world\\'s access to the future of money.\\n\\nThere are two paths to proceed with that have been making the top of this week\\'s submissions: UASF and compromise of SegWit + 2MB blocks.  \\n\\nIn fact, it took only 2 days of advocacy for UASF to bring the compromise recommendation out in full force.\\n\\nWe should not give up on either of these.  Because actions speak louder than words, there is really no guarantee that Bitmain will actually ever accept SegWit even if the compromise solution is proposed once more.  I welcome users to pledge to upgrade to a 2MB hard fork if SegWit is activated.  If this gets Bitmain to signal for SegWit, then I say \"fantastic\". If this doesn\\'t actually bring about miner activation of SegWit, however, before the August 1st flag day for UASF, then I think it\\'s clear that BitMain is pursuing short term fees at the expense of long term viability of Bitcoin, and we can cut them off of fees until they activate SegWit by ourselves activating it using the UASF.  \\n\\nRemember, the **UASF does nothing new if miners signal in favour of segwit** before its flag day.  \\n\\nSo I call on every user, those in favour of and those against big blocks to run the UASF clients and declare for or against bigger blocks as a following step.  If we begin with SegWit, we get a bigger block from it (which is purely a temporary stopgap to deal with the next few months of volume) and the ability to deploy layer 2 solutions.  Advocating for only bigger blocks only is a stopgap measure that leads to the same dead end we are already at.\\n\\nAs soon as segwit activates we can have a healthy discussion about how to build consensus around a hard fork.  And the urgency will still be there to discuss it as bitcoin\\'s growth will only accelerate once SegWit activates.\\n\\nMy concern with expecting a compromise to get approved in any short period of tie is that there are too many parties with too many conflicted motives with too much language barrier and too many details to expect a negotiated settlement to arrive in any reasonable time frame.  \\n\\nI have huge respect for the developer community who have delivered a system that has remained up without any interruption for years.  I have huge respect for the miners who have invested heavily in securing this network from attack.  I have huge respect for the users that have come on board and converted whatever portion of their savings to bitcoin and stuck with it through all the highs and lows.  \\n\\nThere is nothing to lose by activating SegWit as soon as possible and keeping the debate about bigger blocks going. The UASF moves the community of all those constituents forward towards the necessary requirements of the future.  If any one particular miner does not wish to be a part of that future, they have to be left behind, but not forever.  They can rejoin at any time they choose.  \\n\\nLet\\'s move forward.  Let\\'s activate SegWit by requiring all blocks to signal for it by August 1st via UASF.  Let\\'s make the future of money possible for the whole world.\\n\\n',\n",

Do I measure an exchange\\'s importance by daily volume, market depth, or what?\\n\\nI think we should further discuss **chain split tokens** as a possible solution. Bitfinex [has been offering these for Bitcoin Unlimited](https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/195) and it\\'s been extremely helpful to see [how the market values each chain](https://www.bitfinex.com/stats).

So we can approximate economic majority as **whichever fork is expected to be worth more than the other**; that\\'s what\\'ll determine if a split persists anyways. UASFs are an even better candidate for chain split tokens than BU because there\\'s a specific date of activation.\\n\\nThe criticism I keep hearing is \"that\\'s centralized, and we already have proof of work\". I have two responses:\\n\\n* It\\'s not completely centralized to a single exchange. Multiple exchanges could offer the same tokens, and arbitrage would keep their prices relatively similar. If you don\\'t trust an exchange, then you can use a different one or trade with someone who you do trust.\\n\\n* PoW doesn\\'t provide the metric we actually need. Mining hardware goes obsolete rather quickly, and segwit may reduce fees significantly in the short term (they won\\'t just halve; supply and demand don\\'t work that way). We\\'re trying to maximize the price of Bitcoin, not mining income over the next year. Until recently the only mining income that mattered was subsidy, and these two values _were_ basically the same thing.\\n\\nThere\\'s no personal consequence for voting wrong, but there is a personal consequence for betting wrong.

       "  'Yesterday, a pull request was made to the bitcoin core github repository, introducing code and a flag (`-bip148`) allowing one to run bitcoin core with BIP148 rules, essentially the same functionality as the current `UASF-Segwit:0.3` client, but with a set-able flag that is off by default.\\n\\nThis is the second pull request of its kind, after the first failed to receive support (on by default and no option to set as off) and it seems like this one does fair better and might even be eventually merged and shipped at some point. \\n\\nThere are probably folks who would like to run the UASF client but are concerned about binaries from unknown sources, and who will possibly run the Core binary with the `-bip148` flag if the software allowed.  It\\'s important to realize that in this case, such concerns are not justified, and that the `UASF-Segwit:0.3` client is vetted and reviewed as much as Core software, and it\\'s as safe to run as binary release of Core, if you already trust the same source and people who sign it.\\n\\nUsually, when Core software is released, a file named `SHA256SUM.asc` is published as well as the maintainter\\'s public key (in Core\\'s case, it\\'s Wladimir).  The `SHA256SUM.asc` file contains hashes of packaged releases to various operating systems, and a signature signing those hashes, certifying that if you have a file who\\'s hash matches the one mentioned in the signed `SHA256SUM.asc` file, then this is the actual one that was released by Core.\\n\\nThe UASF client is built on top of core, using very minimal (though significant in spirit) changes which have already been reviewed by many developers, and it is known not to be malicious in code.\\n\\nThe released binaries unfortunately do not have signed `SHA256SUM.asc` file, but we are still able to verify that the code used in building the release is the same one that has been reviewed on github by many eyes.  We can do this by validating the gitian build results and comparing them to the released packages\\' hashes.\\n\\nThe gitian build process is clever in the sense that it is deterministic, and for anyone who runs the process, the results should be the same if nothing is changed in the code or in the operating system used to build the code into a binary.  The results are also signed by the person doing the process, so as more people run the process and sign it, we can be sure that what we get as a package matches what we should expect if we build it ourselves.\\n\\nFor the UASF client, there are already 3 builders and signers who also regularly sign the Core gitian build, with one actually being Wladimir, so if you already run Core, you should have no issue trusting the same signer to run the UASF release after verifying the gitian build results.\\n\\nYou\\'ll need some program like `sha256sum` to get the SHA256 hash of files, and PGP software.

To leave out the users when accounting for risks is IMO a huge mistake. \\n\\nOne of the guiding principles in UX design is that you have to assume *users are stupid*.\\n\\nDo you release a security patch expecting all users will install it? No. \\n\\nDo you expect all users to understand what “chain” they have to follow in the event of a split, or how? No! There are millions of Bitcoin users in every corner of the world. Many don’t even speak English (another huge bias I think when it comes to this subreddit discussion of “economic majority”, is people don’t factor in non-English speakers). To think you can educate all worldwide users in time in preparation for a chain split is naive at best, and delusional at worst.\\n\\nSo you have to accept the fact that users are stupid and they will keep on transacting, oblivious to the fact that a split has occurred. That means these people will be unknowingly bearing a huge amount of risk. Example: after August 1st, anyone who get paid with coins mined on non-BIP148 chain, will lose all their money if that chain gets reorg-ed later.\\n\\nCan you, in good conscience, knowingly push for changes that potentially cause millions of dollars of loss to unaware users? I can’t. Sorry.\\n\\nAnother point of contention is that BIP148 is billed as a “soft fork”, but it goes against everything a soft fork stands for. BIP148 threatens to disrupt the network if things don't go our way, while *soft fork is all about ensuring minimal disruption, not to guarantee it*. It is a reckless way to deploy changes to a 30-billion-dollar network.\\n\\n/u/nullc once gave his hesitance to BIP148 and I thank him for that. I don’t understand why other devs in this community, who are way smarter than I am, don’t speak out strongly against this move. Maybe they are just being polite and don’t want to split the community. But it seems insanely reckless to me. Do we really want to do this?\\n\\nI understand everyone is frustrated and I want segwit badly too, but we have to do it responsibly. My 2 cents.\\n\\n\",\n",

I'd say it obsessed me watching that.\\n\\nThere are lessons there for predicting what can and should happen upon UASF activation.  In the case of the ethereum hard fork there was only a small contingent of miners who were on the minority chain at the time of the fork.  But within a few days, Poloniex listed that minority chain as Ethereum Classic and then the mining power fluctuated towards that chain as the price of the Ethereum Classic rose and it became more profitable to mine that chain.\\n\\nSubsequently, there was a campaign where developers and companies pledged to work 100% on the new chain (whatever that meant practically I do not know) but which moved the focus of the community on to that chain.\\n\\nRemarkably, the forked chain is the one that managed to run away with the name Ethereum, while the original, unforked chain ended up taking the name Ethereum Classic.\\n\\nWhile it took time, Ethereum has put behind it that event and its user base appears to have grown dramatically with that drama behind them.\\n\\nWhile UASF is not a hard fork, there are some lessons we can learn from Ethereum's experience, because it might lead to a prolonged chain fork:\\n\\n1. We need some mining support to create a UASF chain.  It's one thing to reject non-segwit signalling blocks, but rejecting blocks does not build a block chain.  \\n\\n2. We need an explorer that follows that UASF chain so that we can easily see what's happening on that chain.  (At the time of the ethereum fork someone built a nice side-by-side block discovery site that showed the height and hash power of the two chains).\\n\\n3. We need exchanges to support the selling and buying of UASF chain coins.  \\n\\n4. We need users to put their money where their mouth is and make those UASF coins valuable enough to lure in miners.  \\n\\n5. replay attacks are potentially going to exist and cause confusion\\n\\n6.

       "  'The term \"Bitcoin\" is overloaded. It can mean multiple things, distinguished by the context, but that is not often clear in the thought processes involved in reasoning about \"Bitcoin\"s. It is imperative for the evolution of Bitcoin that the different concepts are understood separately. These are the meanings I can think of:\\n\\n* Bitcoin is a trademark. Not necessarily protected by law, but it is an umbrella term that, for the general public, refers to cryptocoins in general. It is the powerful concept people hold in the back of their minds of a coin that exists over the Internet without a central control, just waiting to present itself when the need arises.\\n\\n* Bitcoin is a software. It may be true that there are multiple implementations of Bitcoin protocol, but Bitcoin Core is the reference implementation. And the maintainers are key and influential people in the Bitcoin community, also holding significant political power: the Core is what people interested in helping the network will run by default, most without considering its political implications. But much like the choice to update is a political choice (and the lack of auto update in Bitcoin is deliberate), choosing what client to install is also a political choice, given that there are multiple draft competing BIP\\'s which are not supported by the Core but is supported by other implementations (which were forked from Core).\\n\\n* Bitcoin is a unit. It is the amount of money you see when you open your software wallet.\\n\\n* Bitcoin is the economy. It is the collective of people participating in Bitcoin transactions for economic purposes. I believe this to be the most important aspect of Bitcoin. This is what gives its monetary value. This is what we are concerned with when we are reluctant to accept hard forks into consensus rules: we want to preserve its the economy and the economic agents. This is what prevents people from migrating to other, possibly technically superior, criptocurrencies: it is in this economy the people I deal with operate, and it is only in this economy the units of criptocurrency I see in my wallet are useful (not quite, see next and my conclusion).\\n\\n* Bitcoin is a protocol. It is the consensus rules the interacting software over the Internet abide to allow people to use a digital token as money, with all its economical properties, like scarcity. This is at the heart of the problem we face when evolving Bitcoin: old software will only continue to operate normally if changes make the protocol more strict (the so called soft fork). Changes to the protocol unknown to the old software (a hard fork) will fork the economy as long as there are people using the old protocol. And looking carefully to my definition of protocol, I dare say (contrary to popular opinion) that segwit is indeed a hard fork. It doesn\\'t change the protocol enough so that old software will reject transactions as invalid, but new format transactions will have a completely different meaning! Once a Bitcoin is spent in a segwit transaction, it may never return to the economy understood by the old software. Segwit may prevent a blockchain fork by tricking old software, but it **will not prevent an economy fork**. If your favorite merchant says: \"sorry, I only accept oldcoins, because for some irrational reason I hate segwit\", but all your coins are from segwit transactions, you won\\'t be able to buy. Oldcoins and newcoins may eventually develop different economic value, and some exchanges may operate oldcoins and newcoins, different currencies which are transacted inside the same blockchain!\\n\\nSo I finally got to what led me to all this reasoning: segwit, hard fork and Bitcoin evolution. The truth that current Bitcoin protocol is set on stone struck me, because the protocol is what binds the economy together. It seems too big to change, unlike Litecoin or Ethereum (and the later not without scars, as its economy was split).\\n\\nWell, maybe not. Is there a way to peacefully, and most importantly, voluntarily, migrate the old protocol economy to a new protocol? Well, in my opinion, segwit got half of the answer: we can \"burn\" oldcoins to build newcoins. Not the other way around, but a typical Bitcoin user can just hold his oldcoins and wait to see the momentum generating by the pioneers that venture into the new economy, irrevocably converting their oldcoins into newcoins. It makes us feel safe, it guards us of the psychological stress of seeing our Bitcoin balance, thinking that the coin is dying because it can\\'t evolve, but not wanting to search or predict what should we use instead that will both preserve value and my economy partners will also use.\\n\\nThat said, I can\\'t help but to see a little bit of deceit in segwit. Not intentional, but it seems to me that the devs want so desperately preserve the economy on such a radical protocol change that they can\\'t objectively see the economical split the change will cause: by keeping a partial compatibility, hopefully the split it will be swift enough and hidden enough so that no one will give enough value to oldcoins in order to sustain a forked economy.\\n\\nWhat should be done instead? This is my proposal, and depending of the feedback I might write a BIP on a framework for safe hard forks: I suggest that hard fork protocol evolution should be tied with an explict economy migration. Will we change the consensus rule? Call it Bitcoin 2. Bitcoin 1 is forward compatible with Bitcoin 2. You will be able to move your Bitcoin 1 coins to Bitcoin 2 coins, but not the other way around. If economy rules defining the value of a coin is the same in Bitcoin 2 (same absolute total amount, same mining rules), and it is technically better (i.e. support more transactions per second using the same or less bandwidth and storage), the price of Bitcoin 1 should never pass the price of Bitcoin 2, and its economy should die/migrate. I don\\'t see any risk in this approach that is also not in segwit.\\n\\nBeing this explicit doesn\\'t even require to use the same blockchain. Bitcoin 2 could be implemented on a piggybacked chain to Bitcoin 1, where each block mined in 1 must have a corresponding also mined in 2.

This is very different than places like China where WeChat and Alipay already have everyone locked up as customers, and very different from the US where everyone uses some reward credit card and can't see the benefits of using Bitcoin on a daily basis.  Japan is a nation where people still hand each other huge stacks of cash because most shops don't take credit, don't take any kind of digital payments.\\n\\nAnd at the same time Japan is a nation where their interest rates are literally negative, so everyone is holding tons of cash that keeps disappearing unless you actually hold onto tons of paper notes which is a ridiculous concept.\\n\\nSo it's not surprising that now that Bitcoin is legal people in japan are going crazy for it, it solves their problems with negative interest rates and a devaluing currency and for the first time it provides a digital payment platform and prevents people from having to hoard sacks of cash all at once.  So now merchants are accepting it, which is wonderful.

It appears the closed doors meetings did indeed come to an agreement, but not quite what has been assumed by the community.  \\nThis is allegedly the draft agreement:  \\n>https://pastebin.com/VuCYteJh  \\n>In short, what this actually means is a large proportion of the big mining pools have agreed to ignore pretty much all scaling signalling and adopt their own to further their desires. They plan to do a hard fork within 4 months6 months(updated) that both activates segwit and creates a base block size increase of 2MB concurrently.   \\n>In addition, they are NOT going to be using the existing segwit bits, signalling instead their own bit to activate segwit which is incompatible with the segwit activation from core. They are also planning activation at >80% hashrate.    \\n>In essence this means the pools are creating a fork of the current bitcoin code which is planned to be incompatible with any current version should their hard fork go ahead. Which means that every single current code node user, be they core, BU, classic, XT, whatever, is currently going to be on an incompatible fork of bitcoin after their planned deployment in SeptemberDecember. So they are asking the entire community to ignore all existing bitcoin implementations and adopt their software node implementation before that time, or risk being on a very hashrate poor fork, even though there is no published code to support this SeptemberDecember fork yet.   \\n  \\n>This isn't remotely what many of us were expecting when we heard the pools were agreeing to implement segwit provided a hard fork was also available. In retrospect it makes sense given their aggressive stance in the past, but basically this is without doubt the most aggressive stance yet by the mining consortium. It's even more amazing given bitcoin.com allegedly signed the agreement - BU's reference pool implementation owned by Roger Ver. I wonder if all the groups that allegedly signed the agreement are even aware of what it is they're agreeing to? Bitfury for example are in there, who have been vocal proponents of segwit to date.     \\n  \\n>This will no doubt make the community even more aggressive in response with its BIP148 stance. I don't like BIP148, but I like this even less.  \\n>I'd like to believe this draft agreement was heavily revised and is basically wrong, but at this stage this is all we have to go off.  \\n\",\n",

Much more critical is focusing on first order problems: per-tx cost, transactions per block\\n\\n14. Increasing block size does not guarantee either of these outcomes. Miners will still mine empty blocks that could be full. \\n\\n15. Why not get your 80% of hashrate to commit to mining full blocks? Would deliver better QoS capacity guarantees.\\n\\n16. Furthermore, 2MB HF safety is unclear; maximum block size could be up to 8MB with segwit (which is max 4mb)\\n\\n17. Another flaw of your agreement is that SegWit and a HF are not separable or even sequential outcomes.\\n\\n18. Is uncertainty over whether SegWit or 2MB happens first actually good for business?

(that's *this* year, not next year or the year after).\\n\\nI won't try and force you into it but instead would like to point out a few things that might help you decide to support a UASF if you are currently undecided...\\n\\n[85%](https://coin.dance/nodes) of nodes support SegWit.\\n\\n[86%](https://coin.dance/poli) of businesses support or are prepared for SegWit.\\n\\nMiners would have to follow if all the above signalled support for BIP 148.\\n\\nSupport is well underway with [over 10%](http://uasf.saltylemon.org/) of nodes already support for BIP 148.\\n\\nChanges in Bitcoin need to occur in order for the technology to evolve. So changes need to happen *somehow*. I would like to think that the Peers in bitcoins Peer-to-Peer decentralised network are the ones who should approve and activate those changes. \\n\\nCurrently:\\n\\n* Changes are suggested by developers when they release new versions of the reference client.\\n\\n* These changes are adopted by users and the business community if they like them by running the new code.\\n\\n* This is what happened with the current Segwit deployment - developers made a change, the majority of the community said 'yes' to it and have been running that code since version 0.13.1. of the Core reference implementation.\\n\\n* BIP 9's activation method (the one that Segwit uses) was intended to make sure that miners had upgraded to a community accepted change in time for activation to avoid network disruption on activation. It requires 95% of miners to signal acceptance. Because of this approach it only takes just 6% of miners to overrule the choices made by majority of Bitcoin's community. (see a co-author's own recent comments on BIP 9's flaws [here](https://medium.com/@rusty_lightning/i-support-uasf-for-segregated-witness-75d9ef286fe5) for reference)\\n\\nChange needs to come from somewhere and I'd rather it was users and the wider community that got to decide those changes over a small number of financially motivated miners. \\n\\nThere are many reasons why miners might oppose Segwit; the continued use of ASICBoost and the current rewards they get from high fees are just a couple of possible reasons. The reasons don't matter as much as the fact that a small number of them can over-rule changes that are supported by majority of the community.\\n\\nWhereas some people try to garner support by trying to make people fear the consequences of supporting a UASF I would look to highlight the positives in supporting it. Same end goal in mind - just different approaches to getting there.\\n\\nJust to repeat: \\n\\n**If enough of the community members who want to see Segwit activate on Bitcoin support BIP 148 - Bitcoin will get Segwit with activation beginning in August.**\\n\\nSome useful resources to help you signal your support: \\n\\nhttp://www.uasf.co/ \\n\\nhttps://www.weusecoins.com/uasf-guide/\\n\\nEDIT - just to clarify to those of you new to Bitcoin or if you are the one guy who thought I was trying to mislead people by using the word *support* when I said '[85%](https://coin.dance/nodes) of nodes support SegWit' above I meant that they are a version of the core reference client that will activate the features of Segwit should miner signalling reach 95% and lock in the changes as active.

I just wondered other people\\'s thoughts on this?\\n\\nTo me breaking up bitcoin will kill it and putit back into the \"less\" trusted GOLD standard ot currently enjoys over all others.\\n\\nKeeping on mind no matter what they decide it\\'s not goingto make the mining and easier so PRICE POINT  must remain a key feature for miners to continue or it will die or become totally centralized regardless!   \\n\\nSo it\\'s I just my thoughts but segwit seems the way to go an NO FORK as this keeps the price point growth good for the public which in turn flows back to miners. And solves the issues of fees and scalability anyway and it\\'s BEEN tested.  And requires no change? \\n\\n \\nIe. I feel unlimited are looking at it backwards, as clearly we are all happy to pay $1 fees for a currency that is DESIGNED to appreciate daily. EVEN NOW!\\n\\nThat was it\\'s original design no? Anti inflation? Anti manipulation by government? \\n\\nAnyay just wanted to know other people\\'s thought\\'s on the meeting they had today and if you care / think that some miners will really do a fork on their own regardlesss of the gold standard at risk and split the community? \\n\\nThanks.\\n\\n\\nARTICLE:\\n\\nBitcoin\\'s New Scaling \\'Agreement\\': The Reaction\\nhttp://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-new-scaling-agreement-reaction/\\n\\nvia Blockfolio: goo.gl/p95yia\\n\\nA meeting of bitcoin startup executives and miners held this weekend has resulted in the publication of a new proposal for how the open-source project should be upgraded to support additional transaction capacity.\\n\\nDetailed in a Medium post published by investment firm Digital Currency Group today, the proposal was billed as an agreement that would make two changes toward this stated goal. The proposal was signed by more than 50 companies, and claims to have support from 83% of the network\\'s miners – businesses that operate computers that secure the blockchain and add new transactions to it.\\n\\nFirst, it lowered the barrier for the activation of Segregated Witness, the long-stalled proposal put forward by Bitcoin Core developers in December 2015, to 80% of the network\\'s mining power. Second, it stated that the undersigned businesses would agree to activate software that would upgrade bitcoin\\'s block size to 2MB via a process known as a hard fork.\\n\\nDCG further called on companies, miners, users and developers to join the proposal via a dedicated web form that was provided in the post.\\n\\nThe company wrote:\\n\\n\"We are also committed to the research and development of technical mechanisms to improve signaling in the bitcoin community, as well as to put in place communication tools, in order to more closely coordinate with ecosystem participants in the design, integration, and deployment of safe solutions that increase bitcoin capacity.\"\\n\\nAbra, Bitclub Network, Bitcoin.com, BitFury, Bitmain, BitPay, Blockchain, Bloq, Circle, RSK Labs and Xapo are said to be providing technical and engineering support to prepare for the upgrades, though their commitment was not further detailed.\\n\\nNotable, however, is the absence of developers making up the open-source development community Bitcoin Core. Blockstream, a company that funds two such developers, opted not to attend the meeting when it was announced in March, with Blockstream CEO Adam Back formally declining to participate on behalf of the startup.\\n\\nAccording to those involved, the proposal will use an idea put forth by RSK Labs developer Sergio Demian Lerner in early April, though it\\'s notable that several developers rejected the proposal in following emails. (The idea has been floated many times before as well.)\\n\\nSpeaking to CoinDesk, Lerner affirmed that the startup would play a role in the process, though he said he \"probably won\\'t write\" the code that is eventually used.\\n\\n\"Our agreement is to audit that code,\" he said.\\n\\nNo code was released in the announcement, and others were less clear about what technology would underlie the move.\\n\\nAccording to those involved, the process by which the measure would be approved involves miners augmenting coinbase transactions in new bitcoin blocks to signal their support, as soft forks are usually deployed. By signaling on \"bit\", miners would be voicing their approval for a process by which SegWit would be activated at the time of a network fork.\\n\\n\"SegWit can activate immediately and the same bit will say in the future, at X date, a 2 MB hardfork happens, signaling two events with one bit,\" said Jeff Garzik, founder of bitcoin startup and proposal signatory Bloq.',\n",

Imagine if most exchanges don\\'t upgrade, people send and receive BTC after the chain split. What happens if 3-6 months later that chain ends up reorging? Even if it doesn\\'t reorg there will be the fear of reorging and many will consider any BTC transactions after the fork very risky and will sell and use alts instead.\\n\\nI don\\'t like that Jihad dude, but he is correct that its \"stupid\".

       "  'I have become the defacto \"Bitcoin expert\" in my little down of 50,000 people because I\\'m the only one talking about it (not because I\\'m an expert by any means). They have asked me to teach an intro class on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\\nI\\'m charging $5 for the class and giving them $5 back in a crypto currency (was going to be BTC until I saw the transaction times and fees we\\'re dealing with right now). I figured I\\'d give the people in the front row $25, they pass back $20, they pass back $15, etc until everyone has $5 left. A quick lesson on how to transact using your phone or laptop.\\n\\nThe class will be two hours long plus an hour Q&A session at the end so I\\'m trying to cover the basics and a few intermediate ideas so should they come across them (like segwit, etc) they at least have a passing knowledge. I will NOT give any investment advice and I will not get complicated/technical.\\n\\nI\\'ve been working on this syllabus for the last two days and would appreciate some feedback... am I missing something? could I explain things better? anything constructive is welcome. I\\'m sure some of my explanations are incorrect especially with regard to segwit, transactions, etc... any help is appreciated. Each class is 20 people and it\\'s looking like there will be 4-6 classes based on current demand.\\n\\nsyllabus:\\n\\na) What is bitcoin?\\n\\n- Decentralized digital currency, electronic asset, Libertarian’s Wet Dream, non-governmentally-controlled wealth/currency owned and operated by the people and price-controlled by market pressures\\n\\n- Ledger system, not accounting system\\n\\n- “Anonymous” (can be traced if watching nodes at time of transaction... posting of your address publically... other ways?)\\n \\nb) Why does Bitcoin have value?\\n\\n- Items have value because people desire them. This definition does not solve the underlying question of why Bitcoin has value though… as we can see why someone wants gold… but why do people want USD? USD is in demand because there is faith behind USD (and all other fiat currencies). Bitcoin has the same faith albeit from a smaller percentage of the population which allows other people to trade it in so therefore you can trade in it and it has value… the spiral continues…\\n\\n- Bitcoins can not be double spent therefore they are “guaranteed” not to be counterfeit.\\n\\n- Miners see that coins are not double spent\\n\\n- Coins can be spent an hour after they are in your wallet (6 confirms deep). (explain \"confirmations\" and how block chain works)\\n\\n- At any given moment, between 8-9% of transactions in the chain are double spend attempts. Not a single double spend has ever occurred.\\n \\nc) Parts of bitcoin/terms to know:\\n\\n- Block chain – every “10 minutes” a block is created\\n\\n- Nodes – hold entire block chain and distribute it to rest of world, pass along transactions\\n\\n- Miners – verify transactions, solve mathematical equations to tie transactions cryptographically to the next block which forms basis of trust in bitcoin network\\n\\n- Mining – making hardware perform calculations to confirm transactions, rewards are either given to single miner who found the coin (highly unlikely nowadays) or given to the pool that found the block and they divide it up among themselves based on how much hashing power you contributed\\n\\n- Halfening – roughly every 4 years (every 210,000 blocks, which, at ten mins each is every 4 years but “ten mins” will fluctuate... explain why fluctuations in \"10 mins\")\\n\\n- 21 million limit – just under 21 million coins will ever be produced, which makes bitcoin deflationary as coins will be lost over time due to lost storage devices, forgotten passwords, etc\\n\\n- Block reward – currently 12.5 coins plus transaction fees are awarded to miner (or pool) that creates next block, this is what halfs every 210k blocks\\n\\n- Address – the string of digits used to pay someone’s wallet. They are mathematically linked to the private key.\\n\\n- Bit (satoshi) – 1/1,000,000 of a coin – currently the smallest amount a coin can be broken down in to but we can make that smaller if needed\\n\\n- BTC – used to denote the currency or one bitcoin\\n\\n- Confirmation – a single confirmation is one block the transaction has been entered in to, six confirmations are needed before most wallets will allow you to spend coins\\n\\n- Hash – hash is a single guess at the equation answer in an attempt to solve the next block and claim the mining reward.\\n\\n- Hashrate – total amount of hashes produced in a single second on the network, currently it’s around 4,356,704,846 Ghs\\n\\n- Double spend – when one tries to spend coins from their wallet more than once (counterfeit coins)\\n\\n- Private key – a string of text 256 bits long that is your “account”… essentially it’s your password. Yes, if someone were to guess this string of text, they could have your balance and control your coins. Bitcoins are like bearer bonds in this regard. Keys are randomly generated when one installs a wallet.\\n\\n- Around 10^77 wallets available, there’s an estimated 10^80 number of atoms in the universe.\\n\\n- Wallet – contains your private and therefore gives you access to your coins\\n\\n- Signature – mathematical mechanism that allows someone to prove ownership – basically it’s a linkage (with math) between your private key and your public response that proves that private key (and subsequent balance) is yours\\n\\n- HODL - hold on for dear life! Don’t sell! Keep forever! The battle cry of the bitcoin disciples.\\n \\nd) Interesting things about bitcoin:\\n\\n- There is no “from” address. A transaction is entered in to the block as “plus X account, debit Y account”.\\n\\n- Anonymous in that it’s very difficult to figure out where coins are going with the decentralized nature unless you post a public address for yourself, the node you connect to is being monitored, move coins “obviously” (i.e., a +10,000 BTC here and minus 10,000 BTC there, if they know one side, they probably known who owns the other side)\\n\\n- it is like cash in that the bearer of the wallet has control of the money and it can not be electronically taken back without recipient sending back\\n\\n- taxed as an asset by the US government meaning it falls under capital gains when held as a property but taxed immediately when used to pay an employee (tax is based on value of BTC in USD at time of trade)\\n\\n- Can’t be controlled without private key\\n \\ne) How to buy/sell:\\n\\n- Coinbase.com – the only US regulated exchange, tons of paperwork, does treat you like other financial institutions as in your trades are reported, 1.5% of trade value if using bank account, 4% if using credit card\\n\\n- Localbitcoins.com – fairly anonymous, typically done in person with an individual for cash, commissions around 10-12%\\n\\n- Bitcoin ATMs – machine like other ATMs, deposit money, credit bitcoin scanned wallet (typically a QR code), have daily limit of anonymous money movement (usually around $600 per transaction), after that you have to have an account on the ATM\\nThere are 15(ish) ATMs in St Louis\\n\\nf) Who takes bitcoin?\\n\\n- Coinmap.org\\n\\n- Explain why US is slow to adopt at merchant level but other countries are adopting\\n\\n- Japan recently announced it’s an official currency there. AUS and RUS are talking about being next\\n\\n- Overstock.com is huge supporter, many online merchants, check google\\n \\ng) How to keep bitcoins safe:\\n\\n - Offline wallets\\n\\n- Hardware wallets\\n\\n- Should I store on an exchange? Explain mt gox issue and how this is cash, they’re responsible\\n\\nh) problems and solutions ahead for BTC\\n\\n- Transaction limit - 1meg blocks gives us around 4-7 transactions per second\\n\\n- Visa handles on average 2,000 per second, peaks around 4,000 and can handle up to 56,000 if needed\\n\\n- Segwit being looked at to fix this, currently being tested on litecoin network',\n",

       "  'This is a statement from Vinny Lingham he made in a little [twitter debate](https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/867884954625208320) I had with him recently. I think it pretty much sums up, what probably most of the signers of the \"Barry Silbert Agreement\" think.\\n\\nI\\'m posting this not to attack anyone, but because I think it expresses a fundamental misconception. Discussing that misconception might hopefully help to get beyond the current division.\\n\\nI realize that it might be way to late for that but it\\'s certainly worth a try. I\\'m sure, there are still some reasonable people out there.\\n\\nSo lets take a quick look at where we are standing right now and how we got here.\\n\\nEveryone is sick and tired of the scaling debate and the current dead lock since quite a while already. One side has taken matters into their own hands and decided to force-activate segwit via UASF (BIP148) on August 1st. The other side is very much worried about the chaos, confusion and possibly long lasting network split a UASF might cause and is \"trying to force a resolution other than UASF\".\\n\\nThe important takeaway is, as many people have pointed out already, that **Everyone wants segwit**. There is literally no one left opposing it. Not even Jihan.\\n\\nSure, communication could have been better in the past and lack of it is certainly one of the reasons we got here, but who is to blame? Core because they haven\\'t reached out to miners and the industry or miners and the industry for not reaching out to core? Does it really matter? Blaming each other is futile and I\\'m sure everyone can agree that core improved their communication efforts tremendously. If major industry players spend a few bucks to hire a representative to keep up to date with protocol development and make sure their concerns will be addressed early on, things could improve even further.\\n\\nAnyway, it\\'s impossible to make past mistakes disapear. We can only try to learn and avoid repeating them.\\n\\n\\nSo how can we get out of this mess and why is there such a fundamental misconception in the industry regarding a UASF? Vinny [calls it](https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/867886004132294657) \"a threat to the security of the network\" and the Barry Silber Agreement a \"counter response\".\\n\\nThis is a fundamentally flawed assessment. A UASF is not a threat to the security of the network! It is a last resort strategy to deal with uncooperative miners. The UASF is attempting to do what everyone wants anyway: activate segwit in a timely manner. What are users supposed to do, Vinny? Watch the miners playing games with the network? A UASF is the only option left, besides changing PoW!\\n\\nA UASF is not a threat to the security of the network as long as it is trying to activate a feature everyone want\\'s anyway. It only becomes a security problem if people try to fight it and \"force a resolution other than UASF\" just for the sake of it!\\n\\nSo why is the industry doing exactly that? It doesn\\'t make any sense!\\n\\nRight now there are only two options left to avoid major disruption:\\n\\n* Get miners to activate segwit before August 1st \\n\\n* support the UASF\\n\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s get together and chose a path forward!',\n",

This BIP will cease to be active when segwit is locked-in.[2]\\n> \\n> Flag-day activation (BIP148): While this BIP is active, all blocks must set the nVersion header top 3 bits to 001 together with bit field (1<<1) (according to the existing segwit deployment). Blocks that do not signal as required will be rejected... This BIP will be active between midnight August 1st 2017 (epoch time 1501545600) and midnight November 15th 2017 (epoch time 1510704000) if the existing segwit deployment is not locked-in or activated before epoch time 1501545600. This BIP will cease to be active when segwit is locked-in. While this BIP is active, all blocks must set the nVersion header top 3 bits to 001 together with bit field (1<<1) (according to the existing segwit deployment). Blocks that do not signal as required will be rejected.[3]\\n> \\n> **Hard Fork**\\n> \\n> The hard fork deployment is scheduled to occur 6 months after SegWit activates:\\n> \\n> (HardForkHeight = SEGWIT_ACTIVE_BLOCK_HEIGHT + 26280)\\n> \\n> For blocks equal to or higher than HardForkHeight, Luke-Jr’s legacy witness discount and 2MB limit are enacted, along with the following Spoonnet-based improvements[6][7]:\\n> \\n> * A \"hardfork signalling block\" is a block with the sign bit of header nVersion is set [Clearly invalid for old nodes; easy opt-out for light wallets]\\n> \\n> * If the median-time-past of the past 11 blocks is smaller than the HardForkHeight... a hardfork signalling block is invalid.\\n> \\n> * Child of a hardfork signalling block MUST also be a hardfork signalling block\\n> \\n> * Hardfork network version bit is 0x02000000. A tx is invalid if the highest nVersion byte is not zero, and the network version bit is not set.\\n> \\n> ###Deployment###\\n> \\n> Deployment of the “fast-activation” soft fork is exactly identical to Hilliard’s segsignal proposal[2]. Deployment of the “flag-day” soft fork is exactly identical to Fry’s BIP148 proposal[3]. HardForkHeight is defined as 26280 blocks after SegWit is set to ACTIVE. All blocks with height greater than or equal to this value must adhere to the consensus rules of the 2MB hard fork.\\n> \\n> ###Backwards compatibility###\\n> \\n> This deployment is compatible with the existing \"segwit\" bit 1 deployment scheduled between midnight November 15th, 2016 and midnight November 15th, 2017.\\n> \\n> To prevent the risk of building on top of invalid blocks, miners should upgrade their nodes to support segsignal as well as BIP148.\\n> \\n> The intent of this proposal is to maintain full legacy consensus compatibility for users up until the HardForkHeight block height, after which backwards compatibility is waived as enforcement of the hard fork consensus ruleset begins.\\n\\nI will expound upon this later, but I support this proposal.  Primarily because it includes BIP148 UASF, secondarily because it includes a 2mB blocksize increase, which I support in principle (I am a big blocker but opposed to divergent consensus.)',\n",

The security falling apart etc etc. In reality if Bitcoin hardforked to an egalitarian proof of work that equals the playing field for all miner participants the security of the network would be far stronger than today's reliance on China's warehouse mining operations as well as take the power back as users. Users were always supposed to be miners, but when ASICs became popular only very wealthy individuals have been able to feasibly mine, thus keeping the users left out of consensus in the network.\\n\\nThere are very few PoWs that are truly egalitarian for miners with either CPU, GPU, or ASIC to all be on very similar playing fields for hash/$.\\n\\nMy proposal is Cryptonight being the candidate for the PoW change. For those unaware, Cryptonight is a PoW that is prevalent in Cryptonote coins like Monero for example. Cryptonight has existed for roughly 3 years and in this time span ASICs still do not exist, presumably because the financial incentive does not exist in cryptonote coins but there surely would be in Bitcoin if it were to use Cryptonight.\\n\\nCryptonight has a memory-hard properties that give GPUs roughly 3x more performance over CPUs, which is quite astounding because the only other memory-hard PoW that has similar qualities to Cryptonight is Cuckoo Cycle, but [recently](https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo/issues/18) Cuckoo Cycle has a much larger gap between CPU and GPU performance. GPUs being between 15-20x more efficient than CPUs.\\n\\nCryptonight requires 2MB of memory for an AES scratchpad that is very expensive to parallelize. Cryptonight ASICs would have a similar performance gap like CPUs and GPUs currently have(roughly 3x). GPU miners and even CPU miners would still be able to compete with ASIC miners greatly decentralizing the hashrate in the Bitcoin network and allowing regular users to voice their opinion through hashrate once again like pre-ASIC days of Bitcoin.\\n\\nThere are many people who would love to be able to CPU or GPU mine bitcoin. Every GPU miner that mines alts would jump ship very quickly because most miners convert back to bitcoin anyway. I have a 6 GPU rig kicking around and spare laptops that I would love to use for CPU mining, I know I am not the only one here. Bitcoin would steal the show for miners if CPU and GPU mining made a comeback with a Cryptonight PoW hardfork.\\n\\nChina would no longer have an iron grasp over the network allowing decentralized consensus to exist and softforks like segwit and other changes getting activated would be reflected accordingly to the community of miners and not what lines the pockets of chinese miners.\\n\\nThe key here is accessibility and Cryptonight PoW would still surely have large GPU mining farms etc but we no longer have to concede to buying overpriced worn-in ASICs that has a shelf life shorter than a year. Every consumer PC would be able to mine on CPU and more dedicated miners today that have GPU rigs would participate.\\n\\nCuckoo Cycle is worth noting as a candidate for the PoW hardfork but has not been tested in a single cryptocurrency and would predominantly be GPU miners cutting out miners who would want to use their CPUs.\\n\\nA UASF is a short-term solution to pushing through segwit. Every upgrade can't and should not be a UASF. Sooner or later action will need to be taken in the form of a PoW hardfork to take back control from chinese ASIC warehouse farms.\\n\\nI hope a Cryptonight PoW hardfork is seen as a positive change in Bitcoin among the community and we can restore the balance of users having a real voice in the network, not having to rely on chinese miners centralization and finally see a new era of Bitcoin growth and improvement. Bitcoin's halted progress will be stamped out starting with a PoW hardfork.\\n\\nThe Cryptonight specifications are [here](https://cryptonote.org/cns/cns008.txt) if anyone is interested in reading more.\\n\\nThanks for reading :)\\n\",\n",

So far we have done Coinbase and Kraken, today let's target WeSellCrypto. \\n\\n**Two minutes of your day is all this will take.**\\n\\nHere, I've made it easy for you:\\n\\nSend them an email. support@wesellcrypto.com\\n\\nPost in their subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/WeSellCrypto/\\n\\nSend a PM to their founder - /u/gregcron - or their lead developer - /u/MIST_ . (They put these user names on their website, so I figure this is fair game. \\n\\n\\n**Ideally do all the above.** \\n\\nLet them know you support BIP148 and SegWit. Let them know their users risk losing all their bitcoins if they do not. If you are a customer, let them know that you will withdraw all your funds unless they commit to supporting BIP148. Be polite, but firm. \\n\\nNo-one is asking them to support BIP148 in exclusion to the legacy coin, we're only asking that, come August 1, they list BIP148 coins, to give users the option to trade them. Supporting BIP148 is very low cost, so let them know how important it is to users. \\n\\nIf you're really keen, why not also do the same with [Kraken](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6e6xq0/day2_here_are_combined_contacts_for_kraken_if/) and [Coinbase](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6e0279/here_are_coinbases_combined_contacts_if_everyone/). \\n\\n\\n**If you've been out of the loop and don't know what all this BIP148/segwit/UASF business is about**, to put it simply: Segwit is a technical change to the protocol that will provide a long-term solution for scalability, decrease transaction fees and stop ASIC Boost (a mining trick that gives some an unfair advantage). As (some) miners benefit tremendously from the status quo, UASF or BIP148 is a new way to implement Segwit. \\n\\nI highly recommend the following links to educate yourself more fully:\\n\\nhttps://www.uasf.co\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjZk7N7RXfA\\n\\nhttps://www.weusecoins.com/uasf-guide/\\n\\nhttps://medium.com/@lukedashjr/bip148-and-the-risks-it-entails-for-you-whether-you-run-a-bip148-node-or-not-b7d2dbe85ce6\\n\\nhttps://medium.com/@elombrozo/why-i-support-bip148-4b4c0a9feb4d\",\n",

       "  \"And I am also ready to accept emergent consensus, no-nonsense hardfork blocksize increase and any other scaling solution proposed. The point being that at this stage I'm way beyond pride or even own opinions, I just want bitcoin to be usable again. Something it har more or less ceased to be. \\n\\nThe current situation was easily predictable several years ago. That we have let it come this far is sort of amazing, in a bad sort of way. Surely, no side is free from blame. But if someone is most to blame I would single out the Core developers. Not because they have made the biggest mistakes but because they, as the maintainers of the reference client, should have stayed above partisan politics. \\n\\nTo give some background: my personal ideas about scaling were quite slow to develop. I was never involved in XT or Classic or those early attempts and blocksize increases. When segwit was announced I thought it a clumsy solution to avoid a hardfork, which I had difficulty understanding, no one doubts that bitcoin will need to hardfork in the future and if hardforking is a fact of life for a cryptocurrency then it makes no sense to avoid it at all costs when the simplest solution is, in fact, a hardfork. No matter, I expected segwit to activate since it was Core's opinion and didn't think much more about it. \\n\\nThis, obviously, was not the opinion of a large minority of the community. While I'm somewhat sympathetic to their objections to segwit I find the stalling-at-all-costs attitude very destructive and not constructive at all. \\n\\nBut as I mentioned above much of the blame must fall on the Core developers. They were fully aware that segwit was contentious. Yet they tried to ram it through at all costs. \\n\\nWhy did they do it? Most probably because they think segwit is excellent software. I'm a software developer myself and I know the feeling of cleverness when you find a solution that solves several problems in one stroke. Problem is that they weren't asked to solve several problems, they were originally tasked with solving transaction malleabilities. The rest, including the blocksize increase, are their own clever inventions. \\n\\nOrdinary software developers would have been scolded by their project leader for trying to solve more than their allotted task. But the Core developers have no project leader. They don't seem to have any leadership at all. In fact, we, the users, should be their leaders, but we are totally unable to provide this leadership. \\n\\nIt is a matter of governance then. But how can we users govern? We can not even express our opinion in any meaningful way. I am at heart a democrat, more democrat than most. But at this moment the dictatorship of Ethereum looks alluring in comparision. They will probably stumble in due time, as all dictatorships do, but by then bitcoin might be dead and buried since long if we can not solve this governance problem. \\n\\nAs for myself, I'm resigned to accept literally anything at this point. \",\n",

       "  'So I think that there are some misconceptions that needs to be cleared up regarding the difference between signaling intent and actual activation of SegWit.\\n\\nAs I understand it come August 1st there will be orphanage of blocks that do not *signal* SW. This means that from August 1st until November 1st(+ retarget period) when segwit is actually *enforced* there will be a several month period in which the transaction format stays the same yet there will be two branches of \"Bitcoin\" being mined both conducting transactions that are compatible across both chains with no guarantee as to which transaction will make it into which blockchain.\\n\\nIf there is no clean way to divide your transactions to ensure with a 100% guarantee that it will make it into bip148 chain vs legacy chain be then we will have systematic chaos. There is also a possibility of massive losses. What if your receiving funds from a legacy chain address to your wallet that gets picked up in the bip148 block but not the legacy chain and the bip148 chain dies off? That tx never happened and you lose your money. Not to mention even if we assume a best-case scenario in which every single miner currently signaling segwit mines the bip148 chain we will see blocks confirm at approximately 30 minutes vs 10 minutes. Now if we\\'re not delusional thinkers we will accept that we will not have a maximum output of miners and instead there will be a faction that goes one way or the other leaving us with probably much less than 30% of hashrate. 1hr blocks is my best guess. We currently go sometimes 40 minutes to 1 hour with bad luck from miners with the current hashrate. That means that we may see four to six hour block confirmation times with bad luck on bip148 miners, assuming my best case guess of hashrate. Of course you have to mention that it will sometimes go the other way and we will get 5 to 10 minutes Blok confirmation times as well.\\n\\nEither way the more I look at the basic assumptions of how this will play out the more cautious I am about it. In order for this to succeed it has always relied on large economic actors transacting on bip148 supporting nodes, and I don\\'t see how this can be done without widely deployed ecological support from both wallets and exchanges.\\n\\nI still support bip148 but we need solutions for replay attack protection immediately and that won\\'t happen unless we educate developers on the present issue and make them understand that this caveat is currently a do-or-die situation.\\n\\nI mentioned the issue to the mycelium developer and he said that they are essentially looking into it but gave no further information. I hope that electrum and all other wallet providers are also looking into this issue as well as exchanges, but I also fear that there is a status quo divided between wallets and exchanges.\\n\\nIt seems to me that according to the communications published by Major wallet developers they are all favorable to bip148, but so far exchanges have been very wary to make any public statements regarding this proposal. This makes sense because they wish to protect their customers and their Investments and that means maintaining the status quo and not encouraging something that would cause disruption and possibly large economic losses.\\n\\nUnless we can get replay attack protection integrated into the proposal or broadly across the ecosystem fast then it doesn\\'t seem that the exchanges are going to give their customers a choice on this issue.\\n\\nWithout their support I fail to see how this will be successful. shaolinfry stated right in the bip148 submission that economic support is a do or die scenario. I\\'m of the position that if we cannot rally the appropriate amount of economic support before August 1st that we should withdraw software supporting this proposal as to not ensure chaos within the network.\\n\\nHonestly this reminds me a lot of the Bernie or bust movement. I liked the movement because it was a Grassroots movement that was trying to stand up to the status quo. And in order for your movement to succeed you have to approach it with a cult-like fever as to instill upon other people within the public your cultish fever towards accomplishing a goal that seems pretty obvious as to be with in the best interest of the community (SegWit). But if your movement only divides society and allows another incumbent to dominate, or even worse a new player to step in and take over the system that is even worse, then all your movement has succeeded in doing is to worsen the situation at the exact polar opposite of what you were trying to accomplish, which was to better the system.\\n\\nThese sociological effects are difficult to examine from a personal perspective when you\\'re in entrenched in the ideology, but post-event you can look backwards and say \"wow I really fucked up\". I think that\\'s what Bernie or bust people are unanimously saying right now, or at the very least they\\'re thinking it inside their heads even if they don\\'t want to admit it to all of their friends and families because they wish to save face.\\n\\nThink if all the Bernie or bust crowd voted for Hilary right now? We would have a different president. And regardless of your particular political alignment this demonstrates how when you have a minority faction within a system who are cultish in their approach how they can skew the race and change the outcome. Please don\\'t downvote me because you think I\\'m talking trash on your favorite politician, I am not I am merely representing the social divides and how they can change outcomes.\\n\\nbip148 is that cultish social divide right now and I would like to see more discussion on the realistic outcomes that we will see after August 1st and how we will navigate these outcomes. We cannot succeed by pushing our heads in the sand and ignoring the problems that this movement currently faces, and we should be willing to shift our position if in the face of overwhelming evidence we see that this will lead to a negative and not positive outcome.\\n\\nThe way I see it there are solutions to these problems but with time being limited I\\'m not sure how realistic it is to implement these Solutions to Rally the support needed for a transition in the right direction.\\n\\nSolutions for success -\\n\\n1) replay attack protection\\n2) major exchange support (get a single one and it will snowball)\\n3) a compatible proposal like what Jeff garzik is working on or bip91/COOP that has compatibility with current bip148 installations.\\n\\nIf we cannot accomplish one and two then I do not think that we should support mining a bip148 chain. If number 3 occurs then I think it will make the situation significantly less risky if there is wide support across the ecosystem that actually installs that software. If it is installed then it is assumed that it will signal SW which would then create a majority of the ecosystem signaling SW which would be compatible with bip148 because the blocks would not be orphaned. I think it would result in a minority chain that would be quickly abandoned since miners follow the money and a non-SW signaling fork wont be of any value if say, 75%+ of the ecosystem is not only mining SW signaling blocks orphaning non SW blocks.',\n",

Mining hardware owners can remain entirely anonymous if they choose.\\n\\nMyth: large blocks promote mining centralisation\\n\\nTruth: although large blocks do add pressures that may cause miners and full nodes to drop off, they also create conditions that encourage new miners and full node operators to participate, there is no way to know for sure which of the two opposing forces would be the stronger without testing but both common economic sense and the design of the incentive structure that bitcoin is based on, suggests the latter.\\n\\nMyth: bitcoin needs users to pay fees for long term security.\\n\\nTruth: bitcoin needs users to pay fees to incentive mining when the value of the block reward diminishes, the value of the block reward is directly proportional to the side of the user base and has been growing year on year since 2009, with the exception of 2014 when it shrunk. There\\u200b is no reason why the value of the block reward shouldn't continue to grow on average for decades to come so long as the growth of the user base happens simultaneously.\\n\\nMyth: User Activated Soft Fork is going to activate segwit on the first of august.\\n\\nTruth: Although miners are somewhat beholden to users to give the coins value, users are equally beholden to miners to be able to move their coins.

Their mining efforts can be wasted by mining on the lower value chain, and if a reorg takes place they stand to lose the fees and block rewards they worked for. \\n\\nBut miners have a simple way of preventing a chain split and its associated risks. \\n\\nIronically, that is by actually adopting BIP148 themselves, and signalling for segwit.  If miners do this, although segwit will activate, they are under no obligation to mine segwit transactions. Moreover, they can still demand a 2mb hard fork before they will begin mining segwit transactions or set a date after which they will stop or reduce their mining of segwit transactions if a 2mb hard fork is not activated. \\n\\nSince miners are actually vying not against segwit any longer, but for segwit and 2mb blocks, their best strategy is different from their current path.  \\n\\nTheir best strategy is to activate segwit and threaten to withhold some or all segwit transactions after a hardfork target date if the target date passes and they do not have their hard fork. \\n\\nTheir current strategy of launching segwit through complicated code being developed now which does not guarantee a 2mb hard fork later creates undue risk of a chain split and surrenders the leverage they might have for when a hard fork would activate.   This is because an activation of segwit via the software being worked on doesn't guarantee a hard fork because users don't have to run the new software. \\n\\nAll this politics and disagreement is very unfortunate anyways, but it is unavoidable given the disagreements on all sides.  \\n\\nNevertheless, pursuing a strategy that reduces everyone's risks, especially that of the miners is the one the miners ought to follow, and that means running BIP148 themselves.  \\n\\nIronically, brigading BIP148 by running it themselves puts miners in the driver's seat along with users and gives them collectively the ability to still negotiate for a 2mb hard fork for their continued and necessary support of segwit. \\n\\nThis strategy would then become a U&MASF and would also save a lot of face. \\n\\nIf you've read this far, take a minute to think about whether or not this isn't the best outcome for each stakeholder - miner, user and developer. \\n\\nBIP148, it's not just for users anymore. \",\n",

       "  \"Hello everyone. For the past year or so now, I have become extremely concerned with where bitcoin is going, and where it currently is. I have been involved heavily in bitcoin since late 2013 as both an owner of bitcoin and someone who transacts with it hundreds of times per week as the owner of my website Grindabuck.com. I've never really been too involved on the technical side of bitcoin, but in terms of practical use, bitcoin has always had many positives that influenced my decision to use it frequently and hold it long term. Lately however, bitcoin has reached a point where I believe the long-term health of the coin could be in jeopardy. The price increases have been awesome, but I believe this could potentially just be masking a growing trend of altcoins growing to a point where bitcoin may not be the #1 coin for much longer (Note: it is important to note I do not hold any cryptocurrency outside of Bitcoin). I simply am a Bitcoin user concerned with what I see. \\n\\nAs an example, my website offers cashouts starting at $2.50, and bitcoin is the most common method for getting money off our site. A couple years ago, users could cash out $2.50 for only a .0001 fee, or 2-3 cents. Fast forward to today... our users must pay a .0002 fee, which is significantly less than some websites/wallets have to use, which is equivalent to a 60 cent fee. That $2.50 is now $1.90. Where will this end? If we did not have a wallet solution that allowed us to only use a .0002 fee, we would have to completely eliminate bitcoin as an option for our website. \\n\\nWe are slowly but surely eliminating bitcoin as a means of transferring money below certain thresholds. At what point will this stop? I know solutions like segwit are supposed to fix these things, but im staying out of the technical/political side of this discussion and strictly keeping it about practical situations. The fact is, the current system is failing and desperately needs to be fixed before it spirals out of control. The bottom line is there has to be a fine line between rewarding miners what they deserve and keeping bitcoin usable as a means of money transfer for ALL amounts. We have to work together to make bitcoin work for everyone. If bitcoin cannot evolve to the current price/times, it will fail to stay at the top, and that is bad for everyone. Regardless of what happens.. I am personally in bitcoin for the long haul. My business, however, is on the brink of leaving bitcoin like many others. And there are plenty of cryptos out there that can do what bitcoin can't from a money transfer perspective. \\n\\nWe can not screw this up.\",\n",

This third state is to protect old miner\\'s blocks from being outright rejected just because they have some transactions that violate Segwit rules.\\n\\nI\\'m struggling to see why this wouldn\\'t work.   Wouldn\\'t both camps (Segwit and non-segwit) be able to continue on a unified block chain?  Wouldn\\'t they also both agree on custody of all coins? (though out-of-date nodes would see some \"anyone can spend\" activity.)  Could this be a super-soft-fork?\\n\\nWhere does this go wrong?   I imagine calculating the valid coinbase reward might be a point it breaks down?  Is that resolvable? \\n\\nPS - I understand that Segwit miners would need to enforce Segwit.  They could just come into consensus on which blocks have full enforcement, and which just ignore the transactions that involve Segwit transactions (both if segwit txn\\'s are inputs or included in the block itself).   At what point would the blockchain diverge?  The usual problem is that an un-upgraded node could (maliciously?) announce a block that\\'s invalid to segwit miners, and thus cause the fork.  What if those Segwit miners accept the block and build upon it, but toss aside any nonsensical segwit transactions within it?\\n\\nThanks for helping me through this thought experiment.',\n",

Could those who are well-versed in cryptocurrency shed some light and share their analysis? Thanks:\\n\\n\\n\"The majority of people holding BTC aren\\'t actually using it as a currency. They\\'re just trading it. Eventually, even these people are going to realize that btc isn\\'t viable as a currency due to their developers being unable to come to a consensus on scaling. This has lead 20 hour confirmation times, incredibly high fee\\'s, and stagnation.\\n\\n\\nThe price isn\\'t this high because it\\'s being adopted by the general public. It\\'s being artificially inflated by Chinese miners (2 people in China control 50% of bitcoins hash power. This broke the system. BTC isn\\'t a democracy, anymore.) When the Chinese decide to dump, American investors are going to panic. Chinese mine-pools OWN bitcoin. They can make it do whatever they want. And American investors are in for a massive loss.\\n\\n\\nWhat I think should be done: We need to convert all of our BTC to Litecoin before August 1st. That\\'s the date that the btc dev team have set as a deadline to make a final decision on scaling before the whole system breaks. Bitcoins devs are quitting the btc project to work full time on Litecoin. Litecoin has already activated segwit, lightning network is on the way, transaction times are minutes and fee\\'s are low. Transaction times will be instantaneous by the end of the year.\\n\\n\\nBTC will never be able to get to that point.\\n\\n\\nThe Chinese mine-pools have expressed zero interest in activating segwit. Bitcoin requires 95% approval by miners to pass any of the proposed changes. The \\'last chance\\' to save bitcoin is a proposed \\'user activated soft fork\\'. This \\'soft fork\\' is a way to force the miners to implement the changes that they have been fighting for years. It undermines the \\'proof of work\\' concept entirely and effectively breaks the fundamental principles behind btc. When the system \\'forks\\' it will become two distinct and seperate currencies. The Chinese miners will most likely stick with the originial bitcoin and we\\'ll call it something else \"btc-classic\", maybe. The devs will now have a new coin of their own that will be in direct competition with the Chinese.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know if btc can survive this. What\\'s worse is that the room is obviously on fire and no one on the trading side seems to notice or care. All you have to do is read around r/bitcoin on reddit or google what\\'s going on with the bitcoin dev team and you\\'ll see that everyone is shitting their pants. You don\\'t even see anyone excited for the price of btc hitting 3,000 usd yesterday.\\n\\n\\nDevelopment side is full of fear and panic. Trading side is clinking champagne glasses. How can the traders be so ignorant? You\\'d think they would have learned their lesson back in 2008 with the Lehman Brothers fiasco.\\n\\n\\nThe room is on fire. Get out while you can.\"',\n",

What we need is for developers to quit entitling them more than us deserved. I've spoken BIP 141 was flawed due to the high signal level. But what also needs to happen in the mechanisms going forward is to keep miners from hi jacking the protocol for their interest. That's what is lacking. The Chinese have submitted a proposal that comes to the conclusion where miners signal based on what users demand. If a miner doesn't want to signal at all then they lose money. There it is. You take away the reward and they have no leverage to act selfish. BIP 91 is falling along the same lines now. People are starting to see. Miners don't have to do anything unless you make the terms equal. Punishing users for indecision for high fees. Long confirmation times. That was never the intent. Segwit is wanted by many. Segwit is wanted by the super majority. But miners only see that if they don't signal nothing will happen to them. Then you get this miner lead mentality like Bitmain where only there voice counts. The terms are not equal. And BIP like 148 or as the Chinese have proposed it what I will support. BIP 91 which leads to segwit2x I will support. But I will not support anything that leads to miners having the only say. If it leads to a split I don't care. If 80% want this and a small miner led doesn't then the minority is leading. That makes it political. Bitmain can demand a hard fork because all mechanism reward them for anything. Bitmain can hold segwit for ransom because developers are afraid of a split. I don't care about a split. If nodes get there say back and orphan blocks because a few miners won't comply with what users want. It's the developers fault for not programming it that way. \\n\\nSo take it or leave it. Users are wanting progress. And some miners have played you all. Nodes need to orphan blocks. If Bitmain doesn't like it. Then fork off. If Bitmain doesn't like segwit2x then fork off. If Bitmain wants to rewrite the software to keep this advantage they have by patent then fork off. Bitmain.

Sorry it's so long but it's a complicated topic!\\n\\nTL;DR - You still need to support the UASF if you want to see Segwit activate on Bitcoin.\\n\\n**Background** \\n\\nSegwit (BIP 141) was released under the activation method of BIP 9. Bip 9 requires that 95% of blocks be produced with a flag set to signal that miners are ready for it in order to activate BIP 141. Currently about 30% of blocks mined are signalling for Segwit like this.\\n\\nBitcoin Core nodes v0.13.1 or later are Segwit-ready and are waiting for BIP 9 to trigger and activate it. So the majority of Bitcoin nodes are now ready and waiting but the miners are not signalling in great enough numbers to actually activate it.\\n\\nIf 95% of the blocks produced signalled Sewgit before it's activation period (November 16th 2017) it would activate on all Segwit ready nodes after a short lock in period. Bitcoin would have Segwit. As direct miner activation through BIP 9 signalling is not going to happen looking at the current state of play there are two other ways proposed to activate it...\\n\\nBoth still use BIP 9 (so that the existing nodes out there see it) but with a few cheeky changes to bring about how that 95% is achieved!\\n\\n**UASF (BIP 148)**\\n\\nAs of August 1st and if Segwit is not already live - nodes that run BIP 148 will not accept any blocks that don't signal Segwit. This will cause a chain split if there are still blocks being mined that do not signal Segwit. \\n\\nNon-148 nodes will extend the chain that includes non-Segwit signalling blocks as well as those signalling for it. BIP 148 nodes will only extend the chain with blocks that signal Segwit. Worth noting that they will only accept blocks built on top of their chain and not the same segwit signalling blocks the other chain accepts... but that discussion is beyond the scope of this comment. \\n\\nWith every block on it's chain signalling Segwit the BIP 148 (UASF) chain will have 100% of blocks signalling BIP 9 activation of Segwit - over the 95% needed by the BIP 9 rules and so Segwit activates on the BIP 148 chain and it's nodes.\\n\\n**Current Segwit2X**\\n\\nThis tries a similar trick but first relies on 80% of miners saying they are ready and support it. Here another signalling bit is used (Bit 4) first before the actual Segwit BIP 9 bit. The Segwit2X code run by miners sets out that once 80% of blocks that they mine are signalling using bit 4 they (the 80+%) will then orphan any blocks that don't signal Segwit under the BIP 9 rule. \\n\\nThe net result is that 100% of blocks they mine are then signalling Segwit and BIP 9's 95% activation threshold is triggered. Because this activates Segwit under BIP 9 all existing Segwit ready nodes then get Segwit.\\n\\nIf Segwit is activated on the main chain then *all* existing Segwit ready nodes will see that Segwit has been enabled - not just the nodes running Segwit2X. You do not have to change your node from your Core or UASF node to benefit from this.\\n\\n**BIP 148 (UASF) and Segwit2X compatibility**\\n\\nWhen people talk about Segwit2X (aka Barrycoin, New York Agreement, BTC1) being BIP 148 (UASF) compatible it means that they expect Segwit2X to have already triggered the 'everyone must mine Segwit signalling blocks' rule so that either:\\n\\n(1) Segwit is already active (and bip 148 won't trigger at all) or\\n\\n(2) Every block is already signalling Segwit and preparing for it's lock in period to finish and make Segwit live - and so BIP 148 may well activate but because every block is already signalling Segwit the lack of mining of non-segwit-signalling blocks does not lead to a chain split.\\n\\nPoint (1) is highly dependant on when miners start running Segwit2X... as is point (2) but is less urgent.\\n\\n**Segwit2X Hard Fork**\\n\\nThis is defined ([here](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-June/000002.html) and [here](https://github.com/btc1/bitcoin/pull/11/files)) as happening about 3 months after the activation of Segwit. \\n\\nIt will only be enforced by the nodes running Segwit2X. If the miners who have agreed to run Segwit2X keep running it that will include them... and anyone else who then makes the choice to follow the Hard Fork. If you do not change your node from Core or UASF you will not follow the Segwit2X activated Hard Fork.\\n\\nEDIT2: Jihan Wu has stated that he will attempt to hard fork the blockchain if the UASF succeeds. He would do this by privately mining and then releasing a chain that does not conform to the existing protocol consensus rules (i.e. it would contain blocks over 1MB in size) in order to prevent the legacy chain being re-organised (wiped out) if the UASF chain gets longer than the legacy chain. This method of privately mining a chain has understandably gained some negative feedback by the community.\\n\\n**Segwit2X doesn't mean UASF is no longer needed**\\n\\nSegwit2X is yet to be run by any miners on the main network. They might not run it at all or might start running it too late to avoid a chain split. They might not signal in sufficient numbers to trigger the 80% Segwit2X bit 4 threshold. There are likely other scenarios. UASF support is still needed to make sure that Segwit2X delivers what the UASF is focused upon. If you are a UASF supporter you should not stop supporting UASF until Segwit has been activated on Bitcoin.\\n\\n**Summary** \\n\\n* The UASF efforts must continue to make sure that Segwit2X sticks to it's current aims. If it doesn't then the mining of non-Segwit signalling blocks after August 1st will split the network. UASF is needed more than ever as a safety net.\\n* You don't need to change your node (Core of UASF) to benefit from Segwit if Segwit2X activates it. \\n* Segwit2X is for miners to run at this stage. You will only need to run a variant of it at a later date *if* you support a hard fork 3 months after Segwit has activated.\\n\\nSee also [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6h7gy2/rodolfo_novak_thank_you_so_much_jihan_this_is_the/diyzefa/) well explained overview of the different proposals mentioned above by /u/moonkin48\\n\\n*Disclaimer - an 'attempt at explaining..' the title says ;-)\\n\\nEDIT: as per /u/eustan's comments re: 13.1 - 0.13.1\",\n",

It was unethically conducted: A VC created a private and closed meeting with his investments in the Bitcoin space and a few others without public input; and they made an agreement to forcefully change the rules of Bitcoin. Hello Etherum Foundation (Ironic that the same person was the big driver on ethereum classic). They claim that \"core devs\" were \"invited\" but this is misleading enough to be an outright lie: We were asked to add our names to an already completed statement with a dozen other parties names already on it (so, so much for getting it to say something more sensible). It has been promoted with misleading claims of collaboration and support by Bitcoin Core folks, which are just untrue.\\n\\n 2. It\\'s unspecified. The actual signers of the agreement clearly disagree about what they actually agreed to. While \"segwit+2mb\" may sound like it means something to you-- it doesn\\'t mean much. Under that banner you could do something fairly reasonable or something terrible [Fairly reasonable, for example would be to activate segwit, then with a reasonable timeframe hardfork to account for scriptSig data the same way that witness data is accounted for]. The details matter. Critically. Perhaps this was partially as a result of forming their agreement without a single participant with ANY experience in Bitcoin consensus rule design-- they didn\\'t even know what you need to know about a protocol change.\\n\\n 3. Its time-frame is extremely absurd. Actually, absurd doesn\\'t do it justice which is why between that and number #1 several engineers have been just responding \"LOL\" to the proposal. They don\\'t set any time for design review and analysis, they don\\'t set any time for writing a specification (they don\\'t have one and don\\'t appear to intend to have one), they set aside two weeks for testing-- which is less time than even minor releases of Bitcoin get (and need!) even when they were comprised of small fixes which had mostly existed for months already. They don\\'t allot any time for alternative implementations to implement it (which is especially bad because they can provide useful design feedback). They don\\'t set aside time for meaningful deployment by users (some of whom may have their own lengthy patching and qualification process). They don\\'t seem to have any concern about how forced upgrades erode decentralization and privileged hosted wallets/apis/pools over running your own infrastructure. Basically every stage of the consensus rule change pipeline should take (and always has taken) more time they allotted for everything. BU+Classic BIP109 ran on testnet for months before their interoperability failure was revealed and they forked apart from each other and abandon BIP109.\\n\\n 4. They are explicitly rejecting and shielding themselves from public comment. E.g. they created a lf mailing list but when Luke-jr tried to join it Jeff replied saying the list was only for people who supported the agreement and intended to support it. Responses to requests to make their system compatible with BIP141 or BIP148 and existing nodes; have just been met with vague hand-waving about the \"charter\" and deleting comments on their github. This is doubly bad because some of their technical proposals just won\\'t work and will self partition if deployed.\\n\\n 5. It doesn\\'t answer any of the serious concerns about the negative impact of increased capacity on the viability of the system, it just takes the capacity doubling of segwit (which is already seen by many as pretty extreme) and doubles it again. Some of the signers seemed to believe that what they agreed to was \"segwit immediately\" which at least would give some walk-before-running time but to the extent that I can figure out what they\\'re doing, it isn\\'t that. Keep in mind that segwit itself was a massive compromise-- taking on a large and risky increase in load, but countering it with scalability improvements... and as soon as it was proposed the goalpost moved. I doubt many see segwit2x as anything else.\\n\\n 6. Bitcoin\\'s value comes significantly from its durability against change. Bitcoin is fine the way it is-- it could be even better, but it doesn\\'t need to make radical incompatible hasty changes. Everyone who wants cabal-controlled fork-a-week coins have several options to choose from. Bitcoin is never going to be better at being that than the cruddy altcoins which were designed for it (with huge premines to keep those early holders pumping through the waves of technical failure). In a competitive market we should look at what differentiates Bitcoin from the competition and exploit that as much as we can, not try to me-too follow around other things. If Barry and Co can rewrite Bitcoin\\'s rules against non-trivial opposition who else can also do so?\\n\\n 7. Bitcoin Core doesn\\'t have the technical or moral authority to make incompatible changes to the rules of the network. And the dozens of major individual contributors just do not personally support this proposal (for some of the reasons above or others)-- and are obviously not going to volunteer their efforts to aid a proposal which they believe would harm Bitcoin. Probably this one would be the TLDR: Core isn\\'t a company, it is an open public collaboration of many people. Core won\\'t endorse pretty much anything but it certainly won\\'t endorse things which are widely (or in this case nearly unanimously) opposed by its contributors.\\n\\n 8. None of the involved parties have showed even the slightest indication that they understood or cared about concerns like the above, even when people like Matt wasted hours trying to communicate them to them. Not a \"I understand but we\\'ll account for that by X\"-- but just talking to a wall. Which means that its unlikely that the negative consequences of these concerns will be avoided with any reliability.\\n\\nBut finally-- what would be the point? I think that almost any one of these issues alone would make it dead on arrival. I\\'d say stick a fork in it, but Bitmain already has-- e.g. their post today says they have no intention on following through with segwit2x by saying they\\'d only activate segwit if it had more modifications (surprise, surprise). \\n\\nThe tech community was polite enough to keep most of our concerns in private and wait and see it this transformed into something supportable. But we\\'ve started speaking against it since the misleading claims that we supported and were collaborating with it started.\\n\\nCheers,\\n\\n\\n================',\n",

I'm trying to get my facts straight.\\n\\nOn 8/1 it's quite possible that the majority of hash power will not signal for segwit (I think this is quite likely), leading to two chains being created. If this happens, then both chains start with identical difficulty. \\n\\nLet's assume the segwit chain has a small amount of hashing power (say 10% of the total), so block times go through the roof. Difficulty only adjusts every 2016 blocks, so it will take awhile for the block times to come down, assuming there's no change in hashing power. For example, if we're doing a block every 10 minutes today, and we drop to having 10% of the hashing power, then a block will take 100 minutes. This will continue for 2016 blocks or 140 days, worst case.\\n\\nAm I thinking about this correctly?\\n\\nAlso, when the difficulty does adjust, would it adjust enough to make 10 minute blocks a reality with a fixed amount of hashing power? Or is there a limit to how much things can change every 2016 blocks?\\n\\nIn any case, how could the segwit chain possibly be usable with such high block times? Sure, if it gets even a significant minority of hashing power it might not be so bad, but what's the ideal scenario here - ASSUMING the majority of hashing power doesn't signal segwit on 8/1?\\n\\nAlso, assuming we start with a small amount of hashing power on the segwit chain, what incentive do miners have (aside from the standard block reward + fees) to mine segwit blocks? \",\n",

In 100 years, the valuation of a single bitcoin will probably be in excess of 50 million usd, not factoring inflation.\\n\\nWhat does that mean for divisibility? It means that 1 satoshi would be worth 50 cents.

It means bitcoin will eventually become the reserve currency, the gold of the world. Bitcoin is the bottom layer. What is the second layer? Right now, litecoin and etherum are serious second layer contenders. I would say that litecoin is a better contender as a store of value, and etherum is a better contender as proof of stake, for things such as stocks and bonds. Once atomic swaps go live on btc, that foundation will be there.\\n\\nSo, what is next on the ecosystem? We have the cloud of altcoins, each with their own specific use cases. Regardless, bitcoin will be what ALL other cryptocurrencies compare against. Now, that brings us to segwit2x.\\n\\nIf the bitcoin blockchain increases in size into the terrabytes, and memory systems and drives do not scale to have that capacity, it is going to centralize the bitcoin blockchain, as major mining companies become blockchain providers.

The prospect of substantial hashpower actually running Segwit2x code after Segwit activation would, at first glance, seem to imply the real chance of a contentious hard fork occurring this fall.\\n\\n\\nOn further consideration, what seems most likely to happen is that the miners will indeed run Segwit2x code, and on the surface meet their publicly stated commitment, but those miners will simply set their **soft limit** such that they continue to mine segwit blocks that small enough to be valid according to Bitcoin Core code.  \\n\\n\\nIt would be easy to justify the soft limit as a temporary measure to allow time for \"further testing\" and adoption of \"Segwit2x-compatible code\" by more of the other nodes who variously were or were not party to the agreement.\\n\\n\\nAfter a couple years of further work and research, a hard fork to some form of larger block size might independently be developed, tested and accepted by Bitcoin core; in the meantime, soft limits would continue to be used as a means for miners actually continuing to run Segwit2x code to maintain compatibility with the vastly more prevalent majority of nodes continuing to run battle tested, well-maintained Bitcoin core code.\\n\\n\\nIf this theory proves true, there may be many moments of fear and uncertainty between now and this fall, with plenty of posturing and sound and fury, and the Bitcoin price could dip substantially at points - but in reality those dips might be some of the last opportunities to add meaningful amounts of Bitcoin to one\\'s holdings before the next phase of 2nd layer scaling solutions starts unfolding, and the value of Bitcoin takes off on another upleg, never to look back.

In his talk in Arnhem he made clear that the bigblock Bitcoin-chain (\"bankchain\") will NOT be a p2p thing, will NOT be possible to be validated by anyone with hardware worth less than 20k but that it should and will be validated by - the banks. As he says there are 170.000 banks in the world, they have the computing power and of course they would never collude – I mean they never did now, did they?\\n\\nTHIS IS GREAT NEWS FOR EVERY BITCOIN HODLER WHO KEEPS HIS COINS ON BOTH CHAINS!\\n\\nBecause this means that there is now clarity in regards to the faith of both chains after a possible fork. One will be the bank\\'s coin, for everybody who wants “hard central controlled money”, who desires to “stop thinking” and who longs for “strong leadership” (all quotes from Dr. Wright\\'s talk). The legacy chain will be the one for people who prefer money that is not centrally controlled, who can\\'t stop bloody thinking and who don\\'t give a fuck about leaders. \\n\\nI strongly believe that both chains will gain in value soon after the fork. The bank\\'s coin will skyrocket first as all the banks will pump their worthless fiat into it now that they control that side of Bitcoin. The original Bitcoin chain will finally be able to activate segwit and get lightning fast zero conf transactions, sidechains, microtransactions, smart contract capabilities, anonymity and fungability.\\n\\nIf you hold the coins on both chains the bank chain will make you rich and the legacy Bitcoin chain will fullfill all your wettest cypherpunk dreams.\\n\\nSo everybody can have their cake, eat it too and get a different flavored cake for free on top!\\n\\nOn a side-note it is now clear that the centralization movement will not have a problem with blocks however big they may get: if the bankchain gets too big too handle for the banks they can just replace it with a SQL database because nobody using the bankchain will realize any difference as nobody is validating their own payments on that system anyhow.\\n\\nSo the future looks brighter than ever for anyone hodling Bitcoin now.',\n",

By making it more profitable for them to do so. How is it made more profitable to ignore signatures? The attacker withholds the signature data from block he mined block, but broadcasts the legacy block data. Miners ignoring signatures will mine on our block, miners still checking them will wait for the signature data we withhold and continue mining on the previous block. \\n\\nThis continues until a block is found. If the new block extends the previous block (found by a miner who is still checking sigs) we have a fork (with length 1). The attacker quickly publishes the missing witness data (kept it small) once he sees that happen and the hope is that the witness data will propagate fast enough to at least some miners. \\n\\nIf one of those finds the next block, the block mined by the signature-checking miners will be orphaned. Hence it\\'s less profitable to wait for the signature data.\"\\n\\nIs this attack a problem or not?  How realistic is it?',\n",

[...] BIP148 requires support from the **economic majority**, particularly **exchanges** and **wallets**.\\n\\nTime has past and some companies have signed the [New York Agreement](https://medium.com/@DCGco/bitcoin-scaling-agreement-at-consensus-2017-133521fe9a77), or Segwit2X. It claims to represent\\n\\n- > 58 companies, including 14 exchanges\\n- > 5 billion USD of monthly transaction \\n- > 80% of hashing power\\n- > 20 million bitcoin wallets\\n\\nWe don\\'t agree on how to precisely measure \"economic majority\" but I think it is fair to say that this covers at least a **significant** part.\\n\\nTime went on and we didn\\'t see that kind of support from businesses for BIP148. Instead we started to see a massive increase of posts that were less about actual convincing businesses, but more about adding UASF nodes - an action with little economic impact.\\n\\nThe notion started to shift a bit that UASF is not anymore about \"economic majority\", but about running **[full nodes](https://uasf.co)**:\\n\\n> [UASF is] a mechanism where the activation time of a soft fork occurs on a specified date enforced **by full nodes, a concept sometimes referred to as the economic majority**. \\n\\nUASF seems to be less and less about business support or convincing miners but clients instead. Even worse, businesses that followed Segwit2X were accused of being [bribed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6bp4qr/jihanbitmain_is_buying_companies_like_bitpay_we/) and were not \"true bitcoin businesses\".\\n\\nBecause these businesses came to an agreement with miners, and miners are perceived to have ill intentions by some UASF supporters, it followed that businesses might be harmful to Bitcoin as well.\\n\\nThis started the notion of \"ChinaCoin\" or **\"CorporateCoin\"**, a theory that those businesses which were previously associated with the **economic majority** are now evil, and are acting against the best interest of the true, real Bitcoin users.\\n\\nThis drives another wedge into an already divided community.\\n\\n**I think it is safe to say that BIP148 set the timeline that allowed us to finally have Segwit - coming hard-fork or not.**\\n\\nLet\\'s be thankful for that.\\n\\nPlease don\\'t burn bridges with the ecosystem.

All of my bitcoin is currently on coinbase and in order to prepare for a possible fork I've been tossing around a couple strategies. 1) move all of my bitcoin to cold storage and wait to see things play out. 2) convert all of my bitcoin to ethereum and go back to bitcoin in a few months. My thinking is that in the next few months, a smooth transition to segwit could really boost the price of bitcoin, in which case I'd like to hold. Alternatively if there is a fork or large disruptions to bitcoin in the short term, I'm thinking ethereum could make some gains relative to bitcoin allowing me to grab more once the dust settles.

As part of this, I\\'ve read the white paper a few times, Mastering Bitcoin (only once), and related articles and have listened to hundreds of hours of podcasts and YouTube videos. \\n\\nI first became aware of Segregated Witness via an Ameer Rosic YouTube video, and my gut thought was \"interesting, an upgrade to the bitcoin protocol that will make it better (and more valuable!)\". Ansel Lindner was the first person to start to provide context about the warring factions, and through this I learned of a sinister foreigner named Jihan/Jihad. \\n\\nIt also took some concerted effort to figure out that r/bitcoin and r/btc were not the same thing. I first got wind of this through allegations that r/bitcoin was \"censored\". In investigating, I determined r/bitcoin was probably not \"censored\", at least in the way most meaningful sense of the word, i.e. government supression of speach. It does seem speech was \"suppressed\" on r/bitcoin by non-government actors, in ways familiar to anyone who has followed Twitter, Facebook, and reddit vis a vis USA politics over the past two years.\\n\\nHere are the questions I cannot shake:\\n\\nIs it not the case that SegWit is a Rube Goldberg-style solution to the problem of scaling? Why would we we want to segregate the witness, when the \"witness\" is the *the* thing? For the sake of stability and clean code in general, why not just change the block size? To my understanding, the current 1mb block size was not part of the original protocol, so it seems it could be adjusted upward without deviating from the original vision.\\n\\nThe counter to this I\\'ve seen is \"you want to centralize/corporate-ize bitcoin\" - without much nuance beyond that. I can assure you I do not want bitcoin centralized; I\\'d love to see bitcoin dominate the global financial system. Further, it is not prima facie evident that 2mb blocks centralizes bitcoin / makes it easier to attack - a counter objection could be that a 2mb block would make bitcoin more useable and thus more valuable making more wealthy bitcoiners that would have the option of participating in mining / decentralizing the network.\\n\\nBriefly I subcribed to the \"avoid a chain split by any means necessary opinion\". My current hope is that somehow a non-segwit, larger block blockchain emerges and the market can sort out the competing valuations.\\n\\nAt this point, I\\'m worried that a solution that strikes me as highly weird is being foisted on the network. How can I stop worrying and learn to love SegWit?\\n\\nThank you',\n",

The outcome is that segwit blocks can quickly fill up with spam transactions, and the problem actually gets worse as the blocksize increases.  Is this a credible threat? \\n\\n> 3.1 SW creates a financial incentive for bloating witness data\\nSW allows for a theoretical maximum block size limit of ~4 MB. However, this is only true if the entire block was occupied with transactions of a very small ‘base size’ (e.g. P2WPKH with 1 input, 1 output). In practice, based on the average transaction size today and the types of transactions made, the block size limit is expected to have a maximum limit of ~1.7 MB post-SW (Figure 10; assuming all transactions are using SW unspent outputs\\u200a—\\u200aa big assumption).\\nHowever, the 4 MB theoretical limit creates a key problem. Miners and full node operators need to ensure that their systems can handle the 4 MB limit, even though at best they will only be able to support ~40% of that transaction capacity. Why? Because there exists a financial incentive for malicious actors to design transactions with a small base size but large and complex witness data. \\n\\n> This is exacerbated by the fact that witness scripts (i.e. P2SH-P2WSH or P2SH-P2WSH) will have higher script size limits that normal P2SH redeem scripts (i.e., from 520 bytes to 3,600 bytes [policy] or 10,000 bytes [consensus]). These potential problems only worsen as the block size limit is raised in the future, for example a 2 MB maximum base size creates an 8 MB adversarial case.

So a majority of miners can reneg on BIP-91, fail to activate segwit, and get away without any long-term¹ consequences because the BIP-91 invalid blocks they would be producing are considered to be perfectly valid by the vast majority of users\\' nodes.\\n\\nWill this happen? It\\'s notable that even though BIP-91 just activated - something which is supposed to signal clear intent to activate segwit - a bit less than a majority of miners are actually signaling segwit. While no smoking gun, it\\'s a sign that we *may* be in a situation where a majority of miners do not intend to actually activate segwit.\\n\\nI don\\'t think this is the most likely outcome - there\\'s other pressures like social that probably would serve to enforce BIP-91 - but I\\'d give it significant odds of happening. Maybe 25%?\\n\\nThe reason why I think it\\'s as high a chance as 25% is because there\\'s a few ways to reneg on segwit with plausible deniability. For instance, miners could \"accidentally\" mine a bunch of BIP-91 invalid blocks - e.g. claiming it was due to validationless spy-mining - and then decide not to reorg out those blocks. At that point, the BIP-91 rules have been broken, but lots of transactions depend on them, so the whole thing gets called off with vague mutterings of \"we\\'ll try again once we upgrade our systems\" or \"well obviously soft-forks are just too dangerous!\"\\n\\n1) In the short-term reneging on BIP-91 could lead to a large reorg - why I recommend that people be *very* cautious about trusting confirmations until segwit is fully activated in (hopefully) a few weeks. It\\'s quite plausible that we\\'ll see even 6+ confirmed transactions get double-spent due to reorgs. Now, that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s *likely*, but if a double-spent transaction would be a devastating loss, you should be very cautious. Of course, often a double-spend isn\\'t devastating: if I\\'m selling a house I know who is buying it, a double-spend will land them in jail, so I\\'m not relying solely on Bitcoin confirmations to protect me.',\n",

Without him, we wouldn't be here.\\n\\nI would like to thank Charlie Lee for getting the ball moving on Litecoin.

I was ready to give up until I was inspired by Luke and became more inspired than ever in this fight.\\n\\nI'd like to thank /u/lightsword for getting BIP91 into btc1.  Without his efforts, btc1 would never have been able to activate SegWit.\\n\\nLastly, I'd like to support all the users who have been supportive and advocates for BIP148.  You did this.  Without help from Core (in fact, even many members of Core battling us), without the help of mining pools, you forced the miners hands, forced the NYA to comply with BIP148.  Without such strong activism, BIP148 would have been ignored.\\n\\nThe story of SegWit will no doubt be twisted by those seeking glory.  We all know the truth.  We all know that the entire reason for BIP91 in btc1 was due to BIP148's threat.  They will give a few miners a way to save face while the other miners will simply run a patched Bitcoin Core.  We got everything we wanted.\\n\\nI've seen a few /r/btc sockpuppets also trying to claim victory, claiming they fired Core. If anything, the success of BIP148 shows that Core is not in charge and the community is.  No one can fire volunteers.  Their dishonest claim of victory is apparent - they have gotten NOTHING out of this.  They opposed SegWit, yet SegWit is inevitable.  They wanted a hard fork, and the hard fork can be safely ignored.  They wanted larger blocks, and they are getting the SegWit compromise of using block weight.  The only thing they got was a new client (of which there already were dozens) that will likely be abandoned soon.  There are no competent developers (other than Hilliard, who was simply getting BIP91 in) working on the project.  They have little understanding of how Bitcoin works and even required being bailed out by Core a few times to even get something functional.  The only thing they got was a miner commitment to hard fork (miners have done this before, yet I see no hard fork),and a few businesses saying they will hard fork.  Even if there was a hard fork, its far from what they actually want - they claim 2MB blocks are too small anyway..\\n\\nBut we must stay vigilant.  They will try to spin this as a mandate for a hard fork.  We must be prepared to ignore it.  The good news is, no one can force you to support a hard fork.  So celebrate, but make sure to share the truth.  They will claim victory, and claim they are in charge now, but in reality, we all know who is - you are.  Don't give that up.\",\n",

Why they need Bitcoin Cash and what they are trying to achieve - in my opinion.\\n\\nFirst few words about  the role of China in Bitcoin mining so you can understand the context.\\nCurrently **China controls over 70% of Bitcoin mining**. You can find detailed information here: https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/china/\\n\\n> China is the undisputed world leader in Bitcoin mining. Chinese mining pools control more than 70% of the Bitcoin network’s collective hashrate. 15% of the hash rate is missing from above chart, but it’s likely that China controls an even greater amount.\\n\\n> Not only does China manufacture most of the world’s mining equipment, but massive mining farms are located there to take advantage of extremely cheap electricity prices.\\n##\\n\\nMore informations about why China has centralized Bitcoin mining: https://www.bitcoinmining.com/chinas-dominance-in-bitcoin-mining/\\n\\nThe author concludes: \\n\\n> Having so much mining power incorporated in any single nation uncovered the Bitcoin system to a stressing level of political hazard.\\n\\n> Ought to the Chinese government choose to get serious about Bitcoin, maybe considering it to be a danger to their economy or a contender to their own arranged computerized cash, **they could wreak untold destruction in the Bitcoin environment.**\\n\\nThis was written on April 4, 2017 by  Melvin Draupnir.\\n\\nAlso, a famous tweet from **Jihan Wu**, the main producer of Bitcoin mining devices (ASICs) and the creator of Bitcoin Cash:\\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/DEOR3UMWAAUKkPU.jpg\\nYet, the enthusiasts of Bitcoin Cash prove, that its transactions will be much cheaper. Hopefully **not 'unfairly' cheap**. For that we have **SegWit** ;)\\n\\nLittle digression here. If you ask what is China doing best, I would say copying. Don't get me wrong here, I think it's a true virtue! Sometimes they can even improve over the original and organizing low-cost mass production is a art in itself.\\n\\n\\nSo, investing so much money into whole mining factories, using as much electricity as little countries - would China allow to have no control over Bitcoin apart from just the hashpower?\\n\\nIn my opinion: no.\\n\\n\\nThat's why we're seeing the creation of **BCC - Bitcoin Cash (China)**. What first started as an announcement of a small Chinese exchange / mine is getting attention from other mines - of course only those from China, what a coincidence. According to user @ancap47: *BTC.TOP has said that they will divide hash rate on price, so that means 1/6 of their giant mining farm is going to be mining bitcoin cash* \\nsource: https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@kingscrown/viabtc-starts-trading-bitcoincash-bcc-possible-split-chain-of-btc#@ancap47/re-cardboard-re-liondani-re-kingscrown-viabtc-starts-trading-bitcoincash-bcc-possible-split-chain-of-btc-20170723t181124709z\\n\\nAre we gonna see a **snow ball effect** in the upcoming days? Chinese folks have cash, that we know for sure. They will have no problem in investing **tons of CNY** into Bitcoin China in order to display its market dominance. I can understand that - Chinese are a proud nation and they **rather buy their own version of Bitcoin** than the worldwide accepted one.\\n\\nOn a side note: China has no democracy. It's ruled by **one communist party** - they control everything that happens in the country.\\n\\n> source https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@cardboard/bitcoin-segwit2x-update-war-incoming\",\n",

I have a couple of concerns about segwit and maybe you can help here.\\nOn the other forum I get mostly anti-segwit comments, and I want to have a balanced opinion.\\nPlease see this video - what is the defense against it?\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoFb3mcxluY\\n\\nHere is what I wrote in the other forum:\\n\\nSegwit creates a fundamental question which worries me, but please read on before you dismiss the point.\\n\\nTo be clear here, I'm imagining a scenario where one or more wealthy corporations or nation-states exercise control over a majority of mining.\\n\\nIn brief: what if a miner creates a transaction to spend someone else's bitcoin.\\n\\nSince the signature is separated, they only need other miners to build on top, and disregard that one transaction with invalid signature data. I know you'll need >51% of miners to build on your block, and of course with >51% of miners you can break bitcoin in many interesting ways.\\n\\nHowever I think this attack is different because a transaction in the blockchain without a valid signature is fundamentally invalid under current rules. With segwit, it would be a valid transaction.\\n\\ni.e. under current rules, 51% of miners cannot spend my bitcoins. With segwit, they can.\\n\\nAnd once the unsigned transaction is in the blockchain, the only way to recover it is to rollback all transactions and redo all the proof of work. Once you get past 4 or 5 blocks and the mining majority is clear, even honest miners and fully-validating node operators will probably stick to the dishonest chain.\\n\\nAm I missing something?\",\n",

Bob sees the transaction being broadcasted without any OP_RETURN nonsense, and smirks to himself.\\n3. Bob takes the txid of the transaction Alice sent and the index of the segwit output. Slaps on a null scriptSig, and adds an output spending the whole entirety of the output to his P2PKH utxo, and broadcasts Alice's transaction AND Bob's new transaction on the BCC blockchain where Segwit will not be activated, so Alice's P2WPKH is merely an ANYONE_CAN_PAY utxo.\\n\\nSo basically, any users that wish to use Segwit after the lockin period in late August will need to be certain to include the stupid childish OP_RETURN replay protection OR face having your segwit funds be stolen on the BCC side.\\n\\nAlso, to take it one step further, a miner could easily just steal the output and put its entirety into fees which they would use to line their own pockets and mix the coins in to make it look like the miners themselves didn't steal it.\\n\\nYou know, I was starting to support UAHF's actions because they seemed to be amicably splitting off and saying their goodbyes, though I thought it very strange they were making replay prevention optional....... then it hit me.

So BIP 91, BIP 141, BIP 148? Basically we activated segwit through the BIP 91 which was a less riskier way to do it right? \\n\\n2. What is happening next? Did we actually make a compromise for segwit 2x? \\n\\n3. Is the hardfork really happening in 3 months or can people say something like \"sorry but this is too risky were not gonna do it or we need more time\"? \\n\\nOr is the 2x increase code already embedded somewhere and are we obligated to go with this? \\n\\nReason I\\'m worried about this is because I\\'ve been reading a bit on the subject and it sounds like some important people are against the 2x increase and they seem to have valid reasons.\\n\\n4. So do we really need 100% of all miners to participate in the 2x in 3 months? What happens if a small % does not signal for it? What happens if 25-33% does not signal for it? What happens if 51% does not signal for it? \\n\\n5. I\\'m assuming that most if not all of the big miners want the hardfork to increase their advantage but if some of these big miners do not actually want the 2x increase what would be their reason? Are these miners thinking about the bigger picture? Are they thinking its too risky? Bad for bitcoin? \\n\\nHow bad could this hardfork be? \\n\\n6. If the 2x does happen and it gives the miners more power, what can we as users do to help ourselves? Should we try to get as many people to run full nodes? Am I even making sense here? \\n\\n7.

But what\\'s clear is that this **exact attack was, partly, anticipated by exchanges in March this year**.\\n\\nSee: https://www.bitfinex.com/bitcoin_hardfork_statement which, as you can see, was signed by bitfinex, bitstamp, btcc, shapeshift, etc.\\n\\nHow about a similar, reinforced statement from exchanges with more signatories - it\\'s their businesses, and their customers, that get hurt more than anyone else by this shenanigans - anyone remember Coinbase\\'s ETC snafu?\\n\\nI want to emphasize again - this isn\\'t just the segwit soft fork; it could happen at any time. In the extreme case I just make waxwingBTC hard fork any time I choose, which has no old-new chain replay protection, and which adds rules that allow me to spend your outputs if they are p2sh without your key . Then your replayed outputs are \"lost wealth\" on my new hard fork chain, which proves that old BTC is broken, right?\\n\\nAnyone would ignore such a ridiculous hard fork, and likewise they should ignore this slightly less ridiculous one if it doesn\\'t have replay protection properly built. Note: I say ignore, but I mean in an active, boycott sense, since this is an **attack** a little like a DOS attack, but with a more economic flavour (people pay attention to what they think is free money).',\n",

       "  'Hi Bitcoiners!\\n\\n\\nI’m back with the seventh monthly Bitcoin news recap. Last month\\'s post got very little love, and I don\\'t expect much more success with everyone focussing on August 1st, but here it is nonetheless.

The \"witness data\" (which is the rules for who\\'s allowed to claim the outputs, and the proof that the rules were followed on the inputs that claim the outputs) is moved out of the main block and replaced with a simple \"anyone can spend me, there are no rules and no proofs,\" and it\\'s up to miners to know what the rules really are, ignore the \"anyone can spend me\" instruction, and instead apply the rules from the witness data.\"\\n\\nhttps://steemit.com/bitcoin/@modprobe/i-looked-into-segwit-and-here-s-what-i-saw\\n\\nIs this true?\\n\\n\\nAnother questions is, is core and miners still trying to trick-out from hardforking to 2mb ?

NOTHING comes even close.\\n\\nThis technology can set humans into a new financial era. Bitcoin is truly revolutionary. One of the reasons it\\'s still not in mainstream use is because most people around the world are not tech-savvy enough, although they do know how to use mobile phones and computers. In my view their comprehension of new technologies is limited to only what can be used in the mainstream. User-friendliness is also a major factor. How many people usually say they are proficient in MS office but have a difficult time with Excel or Access? How many people, back in the early days of the Internet needed hand-holding just to send an email? Or just to understand the concept of email?\\n\\nA great deal of people are not getting excited about the emergence of bitcoin. This is not because it\\'s an average technology, but because it\\'s an incredible technology that they just don\\'t understand. This is very similar to how people used to struggle with things like the World Wide Web, HyperText protocol, even SMS! Nowadays, we have scarier things to struggle with like blockchain, forks, segwit...etc. Do you really think the average Joe can comprehend these concepts in their current complicated state? That\\'s why bitcoin is taking this long to find its users and uses. Never think bitcoin is exciting like Facebook or Google, it is MUCH much bigger than that. In fact, I think it\\'s much bigger than the Internet itself!\\n\\nNow, let\\'s hear what the opponents of bitcoin usually say about it: \"It\\'s a bubble\", \"it\\'s a fad\", \"it\\'s a scam\", \"it can never work\", \"it\\'s not needed\", \"it\\'s an advanced technology with no use\", \"there\\'s nothing wrong with the current financial system\", \"the government will never allow it\", \"it is not compatible with our taxation system\".\\n\\nNow compare this to what the opponents of the Internet used to say: \"It\\'s only for porn\", \"it\\'s a security risk\", \"it\\'s only used by hackers, phreakers, and porn addicts\". \"why would I need to replace my fax machine?\", \"we\\'re going to make a private internet just for our financial system, the Intranet\". \\n\\nAnd this is what the supporters of bitcoin sometimes say: \"To the moon!\", \"bitcoin can completely change our lives\", \"this is a revolution!\", \"I predict the price will reach $1m soon\". \\n\\nDid you notice how polar the views are? Completely at the opposite views of each other. I think it is these opposing views that can and will represent bitcoin\\'s fate.\\n\\nThis is it ladies and gentlemen, **either bitcoin is going to make a humongous explosion in the world and become as great an invention as sliced bread, or it\\'s going to go bust and become worthless.** In the case of it going bust, bitcoin will probably be known as the biggest scam the world has seen.\\n\\nIf, on the other hand, it does succeed, then whoever invested in it will be part of the 1% (if not the 0.1%)\\n\\nIt\\'s either you make TONS of money or nothing at all when investing in bitcoin, there\\'s no middle ground.

Right now [huge sections of the bitcoin economy](https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_adoption/) enforce the fact that in about two weeks (around 21st August) segwit will be live and usable on the bitcoin mainnet.\\n\\nThe miners were blocking segwit for months, forcing up transactions fees to scary levels and blocking exciting new technology. So large parts of the bitcoin economy came together and co-ordinated themselves to support segwit activation via user-activated-soft-fork. This spooked the miners who activated segwit early with bip91. Make no mistake; this is a huge achievement on our part. We\\'ve proved that the users of bitcoin are truly in control. We who give value to bitcoin by using it and investing in it, our full node wallets enforce the rules to make sure nobody can change the system to illegitimately suit themselves.\\n\\nBecause we can co-ordinate we know we can defend ourselves. If 51% of miners ever attacked bitcoin again (for example, by censoring transactions unless they passed Chinese KYC laws) then the bitcoin economic majority knows it can do a PoW algorithm hard fork. If they try to adopt a miner-only soft fork for extention blocks, we could adopt a UASF to render the extention blocks invalid. Before segwit UASF this was much more in doubt.\\n\\n----------\\n\\nIt\\'s worth understanding WHY there was all this politics and drama, and what will happen next. Bitcoin\\'s blockchain is one of the least efficient data structures ever, every transaction has to be broadcasted to every node. That\\'s okay, the point isn\\'t to be efficient but to put the user in control. There\\'s a tradeoff between scale and decentralization: if the block size is increased it makes transaction fees cheaper but makes the system harder to run for users and miners and therefore less decentralized. If the block size is reduced then decentralization goes up but so do transaction fees. The result is that you get politics, drama and fighting in the community; people who transact a lot always want block sizes to go up but people who want control over their money want it to go down.\\n\\nThe big blockers would have solved this contradiction by completely disenfranchising the pro-decentralization camp. Their first proposal called BitcoinXT would have increased block sizes to 8GB (that\\'s gigabytes with a G) which would have completely centralized mining and made full nodes impossible to run except by large datacenters.\\n\\nOne reason segwit is such a smart solution is it doesn\\'t disenfranchise anybody. By allowing *secure off-chain* transactions everybody can be happy. Technology like Lightning Network allows transactions which don\\'t have to be broadcasted to every single node, yet still have virtually all the security of bitcoin\\'s blockchain. So transactors can use off-chain solutions which will be very cheap, allow instant transactions and will be more private because they\\'re not on the blockchain. People who want a decentralized bitcoin can store their coins in cold storage same as always.\\n\\n----------\\n\\nSo that\\'s why I think we shouldn\\'t hard fork now. We should let the new technology that segwit allows to mature and become adopted. Not just Lightning but also transaction cut-through, coinswap, schnorr signatures, MAST, fraud proofs, etc. What\\'s likely to happen is that all the drama and politics resulting from this will end. Then there won\\'t anymore be two camps constantly fighting to increase or decrease the block size and the bitcoin forums will be happy and calm again, and bitcoin\\'s enemies won\\'t be able to use these divisions to attack bitcoin. We can look at how the system behaves now that segwit has increased the block size and in future years maybe do a hard fork depending. But for now, lets allow the full benefits of segwit to play out.\\n\\nTo make sure any hard fork attempt doesn\\'t affect you, always use a full node as your wallet when receiving bitcoin payments. Your full node will reject any invalid transactions in the same way a careful goldsmith rejects fool\\'s gold. The greater proportion of bitcoin\\'s economy that does this, the less disruption will be had if they attempt any other hard forks.\\n',\n",

       "  '/u/ilogy wrote a lengthy, high-quality post about Segwit2x, but then stashed it away in [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6sbspv/who_exactly_is_segwit2x_catering_for_now_segwit/dlc50l2/) where most people won\\'t see it:\\n\\n----\\n\\nI would have strongly agreed with you a month or two ago. But the unexpected BCH fork has completely altered the political landscape, and at this point I am inclined to say that contrary to promising unity, Segwit2x now threatens to achieve the opposite. I have confidence in the intelligence and wisdom of many of the people who signed the NYA -- who in my eyes are underappreciated heroes in this story -- and believe many of them will come to the same conclusion, do the right thing, and pull out of the agreement for the sake of Bitcoin.\\n\\n**The purpose of the NYA**\\n\\nThe NYA was an effort to keep Bitcoin unified. It gained the political power to do so once BIP148 was introduced. The reason for this is twofold:\\n\\n1) BIP148 threatened to split the network thereby giving the economic powers a political mandate to take extreme measures to prevent this. \\n\\n2) BIP148 handed the economic powers a weapon they could use to threaten the miners into a compromise.  \\n\\nWith regard to #2: The threat of BIP148 was always that the economic majority might join it, not ever that a portion of users might split off with a tiny amount of hashing power. If the economic majority had chosen to join BIP148 it would have represented a real threat to the big block miners, since even with superior hash power the non-segwit chain would be choked of liquidity and cease to be profitable while the segwit chain would rapidly gain hash power as less ideological miners switched to earn greater profits. The intent of big blocker extremists like Jihan Wu in signing the NYA was simply to prevent making enemies of the economic powers, to stop BIP148 from becoming a real threat. \\n\\nAs Eric Voorhees once said, if the miners didn\\'t sign Segwit2x, he would support BIP148. I believe this was a good representation of the position of the economic powers generally. The economic powers used the threat of BIP148 to force the miners into compromise. \\n\\n**How the NYA intended to achieve unity.**\\n\\nThe purpose of the NYA was for the economic powers to threaten the two primary factions -- the miners and the Core developers -- into compromise in order to achieve unity for Bitcoin. It\\'s strategy was twofold:\\n\\n1) To use BIP148 to threaten the miners into activating Segwit.\\n\\n2) To use the threat of a hard fork to threaten the Core developers into raising block capacity. \\n\\nI have already spoken of #1. With regard to #2: The purpose of the segwit2x hard fork was never, in my opinion, to actually switch the development team leading Bitcoin. The economic powers understand that the Core devs not only are the most competent developers on the planet with respect to Bitcoin, but that they give tremendous confidence to the network and have a plan for long term scaling and efficiency. \\n\\nThe actual purpose of the segwit2x hard fork was to threaten the Core developers into compromising on block capacity so that Bitcoin would remain unified. The threat is that if they don\\'t do so, if they don\\'t make Core compatible with segwit2x, that the network will have no choice but to switch to the segwit2x client which effectively strips Core of their position as the developers of Bitcoin. \\n\\nThe reason the network, in theory, would have no choice but to switch to segwit2x is twofold:\\n\\n1) Because the segwit2x chain would rob the legacy chain of almost all of its hash power, reducing it to a performance state similar to BCH.\\n\\n2) Because the economic powers effectively decide which chain to call \"Bitcoin,\" and if they chose to call the segwit2x chain \"Bitcoin,\" the legacy chain -- already unusable due to its tiny hash power and lacking security with threats like Jihan Wu eager to destroy it -- would essentially become just another altcoin. And with such a massive influx of new investors and users, eager to use \"Bitcoin,\" and unaware of the politics of all of this, segwit2x would effectively become Bitcoin. This is why their threat has teeth. \\n\\nHowever, things aren\\'t going quite as planned.\\n\\n**Big blockers have already violated the intent of the treaty through the introduction of BCH.**\\n\\nThe big blocker faction has effectively violated their end of the New York agreement. While it may be true that not forking the chain was never an explicit part of the agreement, it was the main intent and purpose of the NYA from the economic powers\\' point of view. And while it may be true that ViaBTC, who never signed the agreement, lead the effort to create BCH -- everyone knows that ViaBTC is intimately aligned with Bitmain (perhaps may even be owned by them) and that Bitmain itself invented BCH. And everyone knows, of course, that Roger Ver and the larger r/btc community strongly support BCH, and since they represent the main political group wanting to see a block size increase, the creation of BCH effectively represents this faction\\'s unwillingness to accept the NYA. \\n\\nSo there can be no question that big block extremist faction has violated the intent of the treaty, which was to avoid a chain split and end the civil war, and that members of this faction that participated in the NYA have played a double game and promoted this violation. \\n\\n**The Core developers are refusing to be moved by the economic powers\\' threats.**\\n\\nToday the Core developers have made it clear they don\\'t intend to cave to the pressure to make Core segwit2x compatible. And, in fact, they are adding their intent to the code itself, so their position is very serious indeed. \\n\\nThis means that segwit2x will cause another split in the network. So rather than achieving unity -- the entire purpose of segwit2x in the first place -- we will have arrived at the very opposite: 3 chains. For all intents and purposes, it is now clear that segwit2x has failed to actualize its intended goal. \\n\\n**What is the logical next step for the economic powers?**\\n\\nThe economic powers, in my opinion, are primarily concerned with the health of this space and with the success of Bitcoin. This was why they sought so hard to achieve Bitcoin unity. At this point, they are most likely to achieve their goal by scrapping the NYA and they have the political window of opportunity to do so because of BCH.\\n\\nThe reason for this should be obvious: Bitcoin is on an absolute tear. It is shredding all time highs, user adoption is exploding, people are begging to get in. The exchanges are completely overwhelmed, confidence has never been higher. Segwit is being activated which will open Bitcoin to all kinds of possibilities and technological improvements, the market is demonstrating a clear signal that it approves the direction the Core team is taking us and disapproves with the big blockers. The last thing the economic powers -- who are just being crushed by overwhelming success -- want to see is all of this disrupted. And the most likely thing that could disrupt all of this would be to go forward with the chaos that would ensue from attempting to remove Core from its position. \\n\\nFurthermore, prior to BCH, the NYA had the political mandate to preserve unity. Now, they are facing a situation in which unity preservation is moot, it has already been lost, and contrary to providing more unity, segwit2x actually threatens more fragmentation. They are also facing a situation in which they have been given the excuse to drop the agreement precisely because of BCH.\\n\\nIn short, the political pressure to uphold the agreement has been alleviated, the economic pressure is working against upholding the agreement, and the only threats to abandoning it are continued hostility from a portion of the miners and a hit to their reputation. \\n\\nTherefore, what I expect to happen is that the signers of the agreement will seek a way to drop it that minimizes political and reputational fallout. They need an exit strategy, they want an exit strategy, they merely need to find the best way to do so. And perhaps they need our help. The community must actively pressure them to abandon the NY agreement. No one has much, if anything, to gain from segwit2x and a lot to lose. \\n\\n**Finally, I want to say a few words about scaling.**\\n\\n I believe more and more people are becoming aware of this, but it bares repeating. On-chain transactions are inherently inferior to off-chain platforms, like lightning network, as payment vehicles because of confirmation times and the threat of double spends. Eventually software will make it easy for ordinary people to double spend and businesses will be forced to seek other solutions. On-chain payments just don\\'t work as cash for small purchases that require immediate settlement. This is particularly true in the case of bitcoin where you have 10 minute block times. At best, the effort to use the base layer as the primary payment network will result in quicker networks -- e.g., Dash or Litecoin -- replacing Bitcoin in this endeavor, though that will likely never occur because of 2nd layer protocols that will actually make quicker confirmation times meaningless for payments. Slower confirmation times in a base layer may even eventually be understood to be superior for the settlement layer as payment layers become more widely used.  \\n\\nWith projects like the lightning network we get instant confirmations. This is huge for buying cups of coffee from starbucks. Now businesses will be able to accept bitcoin payments without fear of double spends. I don\\'t believe networks that attempt to compete with bitcoin on the basis of payments will be able to do so. \\n\\nHigh block fees were never a long term problem. They were only a problem in the short run because of the way big blockers held up segwit and our ability to implement 2nd layer solutions. It was an artificial problem made for political purposes and now it has been alleviated. We are poised to move forward rapidly and leave this chapter for the history books.',\n",

       "  \"What do people think are the long term prospects for cryptos and BTC in particular?\\n\\nI'm new to bitcoin, but I've been learning about it. So excuse the newbie question.\\n\\nI get that one of the long term aims for bitcoin is to make it a viable currency for people to use day to day. Among the key benefits of BTC are that it isn't controlled by any government/centralised bank. No government can freeze your assets or interfere in a transaction etc. Secondly there are around 16-17 million BTC in the world. In several years it will be 21 million and then stop, making it deflationary. Thirdly, transaction costs will probably eventually be lower than visa etc. Fourthly - it is global - no currency exchange necessary. Fourthly it is electronic, not paper. The ledger/block chain keeps a history of transactions forever. The blockchain means that the currency is basically decentralised but difficult to hack/defraud etc. \\n\\nWhat do people think are the likely long term prospects for bitcoin? Is it really likely to be a viable day to day currency? \\n\\nGovernments generally don't like deflationary currencies - inflation is thought  to encourage spending and economic growth. I can see how it being deflationary can help with early uptake. But will it hinder widespread uptake in business? Will businesses and governments think that the spread of bitcoin could lead to people hodling and not spending? \\n\\nAlso, what real world benefit is there is the government not being able to interfere with transactions? I am in my mid thirties, live in the UK, and bought a house this year. The government has never tried to interfere in any of my transactions. \\n\\nI get how it being global could be useful to people, but is it enough? \\n\\nI get the lower transactions costs part - cheaper locally and internationally. But will they cause enough uptake to make it a viable day to day currency?\\n\\nOne thing I do see the clear value of is the block chain technology and how hard it makes some types of fraud/theft etc. But does that mean that BTC will succeed, rather than some other type of currency that governments have more control over, e.g Chinese gov's crytpo currency? I get that this is against the point of cryptos, but that won't stop them...\\n\\nThere are other things I like about BTC - there is a significant community behind it, developing it and buying it. They are actively solving the problems of the nascent technology - like transaction costs with LN and segwit. A significant amount of time, money, and effort have gone into it already. But again, can't that be absorbed by some other (perhaps gov backed) crypto currency?\",\n",

       "  \"Hello everyone. I'm kind of new here on Reddit and my English is not so good at all so I'll begin with an apology for that, hehe. First of all let me introduce myself with my bitcoin experience. I made two big mistakes in the past. The first one was to sell and not believe anymore in bitcoin early in 2014. A couple of months ago I invested a lot of my savings again in bitcoin, BUT, using BTC-E. And yes, you guess it, it was my second big mistake because the feds seized it. Maybe I'll get my funds back but I expect the worst so I won't get dissapointed. \\n\\nAfter that I was really done with crypto. I literally bought the Ledger Nano S to put my funds from BTC-E on the hardware wallet, but it was too late. The Ledger came literally a couple of days later than the closure of the exchange site. Ouch. After a while I thought a lot and said to myself that every ingestment and corporation have downfalls etc etc. So I decided to invest again in bitcoin. The reason why is that I think we are still in the early phases of the ride like many of you say. So I decided to dollar cost average weekly and this time send it right no my ledger!! Hehe. I want to buy a small ampunt weekly and hold a bigger investment on the sideline in case we will see a big correction. \\n\\nBig correction. Yes. So this is the question from me. No body knows when the 'big correction' will happen and how big it will be. Maybe we will not see below $3000 of $3500 anymore, who knows. But we saw $1830 with the segwit and hard fork discussion not so long ago. So I think that we can see this big correction in november with segwit2x. This is why I post this article. To discuss about segwit2x and how it will effect bitcoin's price. Let's say it will correct again big time. If the price goes till november to $7000 and will 'crash' to $5000 then we still can say that the $4100 price from now is better then the next big crash/correction. \\n\\nSo that's my story and my input for you guys opinions and fror a nice discussion. Thanks for reading and I hope I didn't write like a noob, lol. Have a nice day!\",\n",

At times it may not seem like it, but that was my intent. I will be posting this to both subreddits and hoping that they will both consider my thoughts and try to have a little more respect toward each other. Also, I\\'m sure that these issues were pointed out long ago, but it doesn\\'t look like they\\'re subsiding anytime soon.\\n\\nAs 99% of you are aware of, the users at /r/btc and /r/bitcoin have very different views. These seemingly polar views have divided the community into two separate subreddits, However, are they really as different as we think they are?\\n\\nI like to compare these differences to the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States. They\\'re not too far apart on a political spectrum but their opinions differ vastly. You see, although they disagree on many topics such as abortion or gay rights, they would much rather live under a state controlled by the opposing political party as opposed to a regime like North Korea\\'s or in a place with no laws. For us, this is pretty similar, as most cryptocurrencies are used as a replacement to fiat.\\n\\n\\n#Mutual Respect\\n\\nRight now, it\\'s a terrible time to join the bitcoin community. Insults are being thrown from each side I may dislike it, but there is nothing I can do to stop it alone. However, change comes with individuals who are willing to accept it.\\n\\nLike politics, the discussion of Segwit and the blocksize has turned into a shitstorm of mudslinging. Both subreddits are guilty of these antics and are slowly turning Bitcoin into a toxic place for newcomers. A lot of members of /r/cryptocurrency also express their disdain toward the Bitcoin subreddits due to all the negative drama going on, and rightly so.\\n\\nAs Bitcoiners, I feel that we should all respect each other despite our differences. We all support Bitcoin in one way or another. We\\'re all here for a similar reason, and that is to ensure that Bitcoin stays in this world for the long term and maybe someday, it\\'ll overtake a fiat currency.\\n\\nSo next time, instead of name calling or insulting somebody who supports a different view than you, think about what you have in common. Think that there is another person on their computer with actual feelings. There are ways to have polite discussions or debates without resorting to insults.\\n\\n#Interpretation\\n\\nLike many other situations, interactions between members of the bitcoin communities can be interpreted differently. For example, if somebody posted the wrong rollercoaster gif on /r/btc, they can easily be downvoted to oblivion. An example on /r/bitcoin would be that if somebody said they were holding on to one specific coin when in reality they support Bitcoin core and just bought into the other one as a short term investment. They may be downvoted as well with no explanation, or in severe cases their post may even be removed. \\n\\nInterpretation applies heavily to the new members of the Bitcoin community. They\\'re new to the whole concept and may have been fed misinformation by whoever introduced them. They may be here because they\\'re looking for free money. They may be here because of the Media. They may be new to this Subreddit but a seasoned veteran in the other. The point still stands that you don\\'t know what they\\'ve went through and their whole story. Before jumping on somebody and calling them an idiot for supporting \"the wrong bitcoin\" or being a \"paid shill\", take a look through their post history. You may find that there might be more to the story.\\n\\n\\n#Newcomers\\n\\nWhen it comes to newcomers, there are 3 that come to mind for me.\\n\\n1. Newcomers to Bitcoin in general\\n\\n2. Newcomers to the other Subreddit\\n\\n3. Newcomers to Reddit\\n\\n##1. Newcomers to Bitcoin\\n\\nPeople are referred to bitcoin in a variety of ways. The news, youtube videos, family, and friends are all ways that people get into bitcoin. \\n\\nSome of these newcomers may think that Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme. That\\'s completely fine, but it seems that too many of these newcomers get downvoted and laughed at for legitimate questions. \\n\\nI will delve deeper into this in the Propaganda part of my post, but these newcomers often don\\'t get the whole story. They may be clueless and not know what a chain split is. I think that educating these newcomers completely is important, but then again, it feels that both /r/btc and /r/bitcoin are more interested in rallying support for their side.\\n\\n##2. Newcomers to the other Subreddit\\n\\nBe sensitive when it comes to people coming from the other subreddit to check it out rather than to troll. Tread carefully and talk to them more rather than downvoting them and attacking them for their beliefs. You may find that you have more in common than you think. Differentiating between a troll and a clueless newcomer may be difficult, but take your time and be patient.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s say that somebody grew up in a very conservative Christian family in a small town in Texas. Eventually they move out and encounter many gay people and despise them. They may call them derogatory terms and insult them. Maybe that person can be swayed, to change their opinion on the matter. Maybe eventually, his best friend will be a gay man, or perhaps he\\'s gay himself but suppressed his feelings due to his parents. Or maybe that person will be stubborn and stick with the information his parents fed him. It\\'s hard, but instead of hating them, you should try to talk to them, or relate. \\n\\n##3. Newcomers to Reddit\\n\\nReddit accounts are easy to create, that\\'s undeniable. There will always be people creating multiple accounts looking to troll. However, one thing that should come to mind is benefit of the doubt. If somebody claims to own 20,000 bitcoins they bought in 2010, ask them to sign a message instead of immediately calling them a fake.\\n\\nThis type of behavior is more prevalent in /r/bitcoin, due to the fact that their flair shows how long they\\'ve been a Redditor for. The majority of new accounts on /r/Bitcoin or /r/btc may be trolls, but the few that may not be are the ones that make it worth talking to. \\n\\n#Propaganda \\n\\nUnfortunately, we are in what seems to be a state of war and propaganda is one of the most influential ways to convince someone to support one side over another. Misinformation is spread throughout both Subreddits by users hoping to convince newcomers to join their side. \\n\\nI personally don\\'t support propaganda and would rather be able to see both sides of the arguments, but as of now it doesn\\'t seem possible. It\\'s like if the United States took the website \\'www.government.com\\' and censored anything relating to communism. Meanwhile, China took \\'www.gov.com\\' and promotes communism while disliking every post made by someone who supports democracy. Where is the middle ground? Unfortunately on Reddit, we don\\'t have a \"middle ground\". Whoever snatches up the first subreddit gets it and there is nothing we can really do about it. I would love for /r/bitcoin to be a place where neutral people discuss their thoughts and /r/bitcoinsegwit and /r/bitcoin8mb can be for those who support different views. However, this will never happen and we have to deal with it. \\n\\n\\n#Trolls / Derogatory Terms / Freedom of Speech\\n\\nThere are lots of trolls in the Bitcoin community. There will always be trolls on the internet whether we like it or not. Both /r/bitcoin and /r/btc have different ways of dealing with the trolls, but the fact remains that trolls exist even after other trolls are dealt with.\\n\\nTo all you trolls out there, the ones that go into the opposing subreddit and insult others, I have a question for you. Why? You can try to justify your behavior by saying that you\\'re trying to open the eyes of the censored individuals or that you\\'re helping newcomers by preventing them from investing in the wrong coin that you believe is going to 0. However, using derogatory terms is disrespectful. Is it too much to ask to use proper or neutral terms for the opposing side\\'s coin? It\\'s not like you have to call the other coin the \"true bitcoin\", just use a name acceptable by them instead of purposely triggering them by using names that are deemed unsatisfactory by the other side.\\n\\nAs for derogatory terms used on their own subreddit, I dislike it for sure.

The important part is that this was something that I needed to get out of my mind and onto the Internet.

They've basically built all of this, including segwit, which should get activated soon.\\n\\nThen you have another group who are pushing for segwit2x. They are basically saying that segwit on it's own isn't enough, we also need to increase the blocksize right now. There is also perhaps some feeling that bitcore is too controlling and doesn't listen to certain groups needs enough. So that's why there is a desire to hard fork and basically oust bitcore from the scene, letting the segwit2x group take control.\\n\\nNow, my main question and concern here is, what is going to happen to development of bitcoin if the segwit2x chain becomes the standard? I constantly hear about the core developers, but who are the OTHER developers who will be taking over? Where do they come from and what interests do they serve? Do they have any plans going forward? Do we even know if these new devs have the experience and knowledge necessary to handle this? I mean, what have they really done so far aside from taking the segwit code and just changing the blocksize? I'm not trying to be accusatory here, just trying to understand. Clearly there are a lot of smart people out there who have some faith in the segwit2x solution. I'm just trying to understand what this outcome really means going forward.\",\n",

Forrest Voight (forrestv), the P2Pool creator, has been inactive in the project for years so an unofficial upgrade is provided by me:**\\n\\n**https://github.com/veqtrus/p2pool/releases/tag/16.1-segwit**\\n\\n[GPG public key](/r/publickeyexchange/comments/3e7qee/uveqtrus_public_key/)\\n\\n# Background\\n\\nIn a few days segwit is activating so every mining pool needs to upgrade. This also applies to P2Pool. With P2Pool though being a decentralized mining protocol this is more complex than simply updating your mining software as P2Pool forms its own blockchain, the \"sharechain\", which is used to track payouts to miners. Any change to how P2Pool works which affects the validity of each share, as is the case with any upgrade to the chain being mined i.e. Bitcoin, requires coordination from the majority of P2Pool miners.\\n\\nLast year I posted a [pull request](https://github.com/p2pool/p2pool/pull/327) to the main P2Pool repository with a patch to enable segwit compatibility. After testing on my part the patch was included in the [Vertcoin P2Pool](https://github.com/vertcoin/p2pool-vtc/commits/46c0a5841fe180ec1473908dc94051839d582df7) and has been working with great success making P2Pool among the largest Vertcoin pools. In fact after P2Pool\\'s rise in popularity a [second P2Pool network](https://vertcoin.org/blog/2nd-vertcoin-p2pool-network/) was introduced for smaller miners.\\n\\nMeanwhile big block populist Jonathan Toomim (jtoomim) has made a P2Pool fork and increased the share size limit from 50 kB per 30 seconds to **1 MB**. While an increase was reasonable and in fact I included one in the segwit patch (to 100 kB) before him the excessive increase on jtoomim\\'s fork is compatible with the BU vision campaigned by him and contradicts the decentralized nature of P2Pool. Now jtoomim has merged my segwit patch and made it a [requirement](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=18313.msg20873751#msg20873751) [edit: albeit it can be manually overriden] to use btc1 (segwit2x) [misleading](https://github.com/p2pool/p2pool/pull/327#issuecomment-322325266) users that his fork is a segwit upgrade.',\n",

Thanks a lot in advance:\\n\\n1. SegWit alone does not tackle Scaling issues... Other than freeing up a bit of space in the existing blocks. I think I have a decent understanding of why and by how much going to \"block weight\" will help. Won\\'t that extra space be used up by growth of BTC in 1-2 years at the latest? Given the speed \"we\\'re\" growing right now?\\n2. Keeping 1. in mind: Transaction Costs are OUT OF CONTROL ALREADY, TODAY! To the point that I\\'m only HODLING right now and not using Bitcoin for payments as I\\'ve often done in the past. That will favor Shit- and Alt-Coins, won\\'t it? For me personally, LiteCoin, Ether and Dash are looking mighty attractive right now! \\nIs that not enriching the miners at the cost of normal day to day users and future Bitcoin Market Share?\\n3. Legacy compatibility: Why does it matter EVEN 1 BIT? Without signatures in the block, you can\\'t verify transactions, so who gives a fuck if it\\'s legacy compatible or not, if you NEED the segwit layer to insure safe transactions?\\n\\nI feel like I\\'m missing something? Why is everybody hyping pure SegWit and railing against 2x?\\nI understand why BCH is a piece of shit right now and has multiple HUGE problems that keep it from being viable, but I just don\\'t understand what\\'s supposed to be bad about 2x?\\n\\nThe only SLIGHT downside I can see is that the Blockchain will grow in size a bit faster...

This altcoin is being created by Bloq, a company of which Jeff Garzik is the co-founder and BitPay is a partner. Segwit2x-coin is differs from Bitcoin in that it has double the block size. Currently, 90% of all hash power is pledging that it will quit mining Bitcoin and start mining segwit2x-coin after its launch. This intention is signalled by writing \"[NYA](https://medium.com/@DCGco/bitcoin-scaling-agreement-at-consensus-2017-133521fe9a77)\" (New-York Agreement) into blocks as can be seen [here](https://www.xbt.eu/).\\n\\nThis means that the majority of the hashpower will be mining segwit2x after its launch and that **breadwallet will no longer be a Bitcoin wallet but changes into a segwit2x-coin wallet**.\\n\\n**Consequences**\\n\\nBreadwallet funds will be at risk. After the launch of the segwit2x altcoin, the following serious issues exist while using breadwallet.\\n\\n**Scenario 1**\\n\\nBitcoin permanently keeps the majority of the hash power. In that case, breadwallet continues to functions as a normal BTC wallet.\\n\\n**Scenario 2**\\n\\nThe segwit2x altcoin permanently receives the majority of the SHA-256 hash power.\\n\\n* Breadwallet ceases to be a bitcoin wallet. It has instantly become a segwit2x altcoin wallet.\\n\\n* The balance shown will be in segwit2x altcoin tokens, not BTC. The balance is unlikely to change in cryptocurrency units, however the fiat value will be different as the exchange rate of segwit2x-coin and bitcoin can be expected to be different.\\n\\n* A payment to a counterparty that expects to receive BTC has two cases: (1) The payment seems to fail because only segwit2x-coin is sent whereas the counterparty expects to receive BTC; or (2) the payment succeeds but both segwit2x-coin and BTC is being sent because the transaction is maliciously broadcast to both types of nodes by the counterparty (this is possbile due to lack of replay protection in segwit2x). Both cases result in loss of funds. In case (1) the segwit2x-coin is sent but the counterparty will never see nor confirm the payment, resulting in the loss of the sent segwit2x-coin. In case (2) both BTC and segwit2x-coin is sent to the counterparty, whereas the user intended to send only segwit2x-coin, resulting in the unintentional sending and loss of the same amount of BTC.\\n\\n* Receiving a payment from a counterparty may lead to a loss. A user expecting to receive BTC but receiving segwit2x-coin instead might not be aware of this because breadwallet considers segwit2x-coin to be equal to BTC. If the user is unaware of the difference, the user is duped into accepting a potentially lower valued segwit2x-coin amount (in fiat terms) instead of BTC.\\n\\n**Scenario 3**\\n\\nThe segwit2x altcoin initially receives the majority of the hash power. At some later point in time, the Bitcoin blockchain regains the majority of the hash power.\\n\\n* Breadwallet will switch from being a BTC wallet to being a segwit-coin wallet and back to being a BTC wallet.\\n\\n* Depending on which chain breadwallet is following, it is either showing a segwit2x-coin balance or a BTC balance.\\n\\n* A payment to a counterparty can either cause BTC or segwit2x-coin to be sent, depending on which chain is being followed at the moment the payment is broadcast to the network. The user risks losing funds when the transaction is broadcast to both types of nodes or is maliciously being replayed by the counterparty.\\n\\n* Receiving a payment from a counterparty may lead to a loss. A user cannot be sure which coin it is receiving because it depends on which chain breadwallet considers to be Bitcoin.\\n\\n**Scenario 4**\\n\\nThe segwit2x altcoin and Bitcoin alternately receive the majority of the hash power.\\n\\nConsequences are left as an exercise for the reader.\\n\\n**Additional notes**\\n\\nBreadwallet incorrectly believes that the chain with the most hashpower is Bitcoin. In reality, fully validating nodes define the Bitcoin blockchain. What constitutes \"Bitcoin\" is well established amongst the great majority of the cryptocurrency community. It is the coin as defined by the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) (by Satoshi Nakamoto) and as implemented by the software published by a group of developers commonly referred to as \"Bitcoin Core\" and which is published on the bitcoin.org website. Within the cryptocurrency community, there can be no doubt about what Bitcoin is.\\n\\nThe claim that segwit2x is \"Bitcoin\" is therefore a fraudulent claim. Companies trying to sell segwit2x-coin as Bitcoin are likely to be committing fraud in many jurisdictions.\\n\\n**Recommended reading**\\n\\nBitcoin Core: \"[Correcting misinformation on Segwit2x and btc1](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2017/08/18/btc1-misleading-statements/)\".\\n',\n",
